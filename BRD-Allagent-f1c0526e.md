| category       |       | threshold      |       | quantity_sold  |
| initial_stock  |       | urgency        |       | sale_date      |

```

### Additional Database Considerations

- **Normalization:** Ensure that the database is normalized to at least the third normal form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
- **Triggers:** Implement triggers to automatically update `current_stock_level` in the Products table when a sale is recorded in the Sales table.
- **Constraints:** Ensure that all foreign key relationships are enforced to maintain referential integrity.
- **Security:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and operations based on user roles.
