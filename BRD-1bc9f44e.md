### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for the design, development, and implementation of the system.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking and restocking predictions.
- Minimize waste and reduce stock shortages and overstocking.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and supply chain teams face challenges in accurately tracking inventory levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies in the supply chain and impacts sales forecasting. The current systems lack real-time tracking and automated alerts, which are crucial for effective inventory management.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all stakeholders.
- Reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by at least 20%.
- Improved supply chain efficiency and better sales forecasting accuracy.
