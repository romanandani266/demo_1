# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

## 1. Introduction

### Overview
The **Retail Inventory Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline inventory management for retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers. The system aims to provide real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis to improve operational efficiency, reduce waste, and ensure optimal stock levels.

## 2. Compliance and Regulatory Standards

### Overview
To ensure the system complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system will adhere to applicable regulations such as **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, and **PCI-DSS**, depending on the nature of the data being processed and the business requirements.

---

### Applicable Regulations and Compliance Requirements

#### 1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- **Applicability**: GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU), such as user information (e.g., name, email, role).
- **Key Compliance Requirements**:
  - **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process data necessary for the system's functionality.
  - **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
  - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
  - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
  - **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
  - **Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with GDPR.
- **Implementation in the System**:
  - Implement a consent management module for user data collection.
  - Encrypt sensitive data fields such as `email` and `user_id`.
  - Provide a user interface for data access and deletion requests.
  - Log all data access and modification events in the **System Logs Table**.
  - Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for data transmission.

#### 2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**
- **Applicability**: HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). While the current system does not explicitly handle PHI, this regulation may apply if future features involve health-related data.
- **Key Compliance Requirements**:
  - **Access Controls**: Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.
  - **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all data access and modifications.
  - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
  - **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
  - **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with HIPAA.
- **Implementation in the System**:
  - Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) using the `role` field in the **Users Table**.
  - Log all access and changes to sensitive data in the **System Logs Table**.
  - Encrypt sensitive data fields and use secure communication protocols.

#### 3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**
- **Applicability**: PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information. While the current system does not handle payment data, this regulation may apply if future features involve payment processing.
- **Key Compliance Requirements**:
  - **Secure Storage**: Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization.
  - **Encryption**: Encrypt cardholder data using strong encryption methods.
  - **Access Controls**: Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel only.
  - **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly test and monitor the system for vulnerabilities.
  - **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs of all access to cardholder data.
- **Implementation in the System**:
  - If payment processing is added, integrate with PCI-compliant payment gateways.
  - Do not store sensitive payment data in the database.
  - Log all payment-related events in the **System Logs Table**.

### Security Measures

#### 1. **Data Encryption**
- Encrypt sensitive data fields such as `email`, `user_id`, and any future payment-related fields.
- Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).

#### 2. **Access Controls**
- Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) using the `role` field in the **Users Table**.
- Restrict access to sensitive data and system functionalities based on user roles.

#### 3. **Secure Communication**
- Use HTTPS for all data transmission.
- Implement secure API authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0).

#### 4. **Audit Logs**
- Log all access, modifications, and deletions of sensitive data in the **System Logs Table**.
- Include details such as `event_type`, `event_details`, and `created_at`.

#### 5. **Vulnerability Management**
- Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing.
- Apply security patches and updates promptly.

---

### Data Privacy Rules

#### 1. **Data Minimization**
- Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.

#### 2. **User Consent**
- Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
- Provide a clear privacy policy outlining data usage.

#### 3. **Data Retention**
- Define and enforce data retention policies.
- Automatically delete or anonymize data after the retention period expires.

#### 4. **Right to Access and Erasure**
- Provide a user interface for users to access their data and request its deletion.

---

### Audit Controls

#### 1. **System Logs Table**
- Log all critical events, including data access, modifications, and deletions.
- Include details such as `log_id`, `event_type`, `event_details`, and `created_at`.

#### 2. **Triggers**
- Implement triggers to log changes to critical tables (e.g., Inventory, Sales).
- Example: Log all updates to the `stock_level` field in the **Inventory Table**.

#### 3. **Regular Audits**
- Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
- Use automated tools to monitor and analyze audit logs.

---

### Validation of Compliance

#### 1. **During Implementation**
- Conduct a compliance review during the design and development phases.
- Use automated tools to validate data encryption, access controls, and audit logs.

#### 2. **Post-Implementation**
- Perform regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulations.
- Monitor system logs and alerts for potential compliance violations.

#### 3. **Third-Party Assessments**
- Engage third-party auditors to validate compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.
