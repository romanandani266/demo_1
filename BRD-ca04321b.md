## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following functionalities:
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis

The system will be a web-based application, developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React. It will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting or mobile application development.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient inventory management system.
- Track product stock levels accurately.
- Predict restocking needs to minimize waste.
- Enhance supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and warehouse managers face challenges in managing inventory levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies in the supply chain and impacts sales forecasting. The current systems lack real-time tracking and automated alerts, making it difficult to respond promptly to inventory needs.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement real-time inventory tracking to reduce stock shortages.
- Provide automated restocking alerts to prevent overstocking.
- Analyze sales trends to improve forecasting accuracy.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Reduction in stock shortages and overstocking incidents.
- Improved supply chain efficiency and sales forecasting accuracy.
