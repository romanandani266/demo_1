# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline and document the business and technical requirements for the Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for project stakeholders, developers, and business managers throughout the development process, ensuring alignment with business objectives and facilitating clear communication and understanding between all parties involved.

### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will focus on developing a web-based application that provides functionalities such as real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis. Integrations with PepsiCo's supply chain system and other necessary APIs will be included to enable seamless data exchange. The project will exclude features like advanced AI-driven forecasting and mobile application development.

### Business Objectives
- Improve inventory visibility across retail partners and warehouses.
- Enhance decision-making with real-time data on inventory levels.
- Enable timely restocking with automated alerts to prevent stockouts and overstocking.
- Facilitate accurate sales trend analysis to improve forecasting and sales strategies.

### Problem Statement
Current challenges include inefficiencies in tracking inventory, manual restocking processes prone to errors, and difficulties in managing and analyzing sales trends. Additionally, there is a need for secure user authentication and data management.

### Goals & Objectives
- Reduce stockouts by 20% within the first year.
- Provide real-time analytics to monitor inventory levels and sales trends.
- Improve inventory accuracy by implementing automated tools for tracking and reporting.

### Key Success Criteria
- Response time for user interactions should be less than 2 seconds.
- Achieve 95% accuracy in real-time inventory tracking and reporting.
- Target a user adoption rate of 80% among retail partners and warehouse managers within the first six months.

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

### In-Scope Items
- User authentication and management with role-based access control (Admin, Warehouse Manager, Retail Partner) and secure JWT-based authentication.
- Real-time inventory management including product CRUD operations, stock level tracking, low-stock alerts, and product categorization.
- Reporting and sales analytics via a dashboard offering sales trends, graphical reports, and sales report generation capabilities.
- Integration with external systems through API endpoints for data retrieval, particularly for inventory and sales data.

### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Development of a mobile application version of the system.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- Assumption that users will have consistent internet access for real-time tracking.
- Project constraints include a budget limitation for advanced analytics and dependencies on third-party APIs for seamless integration.

#### Inventory Management
- **Use Case**: As an inventory manager, I want to view and update inventory levels, receive alerts for low stock, and categorize products efficiently.
- **User Stories**: Product CRUD operations, stock level display, low-stock alerts, product categorization.

#### Reporting & Sales Analytics
- **Use Case**: As a business analyst, I want to view sales trends and generate reports to aid in strategic decision-making.
- **User Stories**: Dashboard with sales trends, graphical reports, sales report generation.

#### Integration with External Systems
- **Use Case**: As a developer, I need to ensure secure and efficient data retrieval from backend systems via APIs.
- **User Stories**: API endpoint consumption detailed in the API Endpoints Consumption section below.

### Frontend

#### API Endpoints Consumption
- **Endpoint URL**: [Backend API Base URL]/inventory-data
- **HTTP Method**: GET
- **Request Parameters**: 
  - `productId` (string, required): ID of the product.
- **Response Body**: JSON containing product inventory details.
