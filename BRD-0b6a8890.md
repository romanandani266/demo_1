## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for the design, development, and implementation of the system.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking and restocking predictions.
- Minimize waste and reduce stock shortages and overstocking.

#### Problem Statement
Retail businesses face challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in lost sales opportunities and increased holding costs. The current manual processes are inefficient and prone to errors, impacting the overall supply chain efficiency.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking within the first year.
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15% through better sales forecasting.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all target users.
- Real-time inventory tracking with a 95% accuracy rate.
- Automated restocking alerts with a response time of less than 5 minutes.
- Positive feedback from at least 80% of the target audience within the first three months of deployment.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking functionality.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis tools.
- Web-based user interface with a minimalistic dashboard.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- The project is constrained by budget limitations for advanced analytics.
- Internet connectivity is required for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **User Story 1**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels fall below a certain threshold.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 2 seconds.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional retail locations.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database and be accessible to authorized users.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**: [Insert DFDs here]

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: [Insert wireframes here]
- **User Journey Mapping**: [Insert user journey maps here]
- **User Interface Specifications**: Minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation.
