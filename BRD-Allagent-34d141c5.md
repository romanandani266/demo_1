#### **Database Requirements**
- PostgreSQL will be used as the database solution for its scalability, reliability, and support for complex queries.

#### **Security Requirements**
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access specific features.
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data must be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
- **Compliance**: The system must comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

#### **Known Constraints**
- The system must operate within the existing IT infrastructure of PepsiCo and its retail partners.
- Limited budget and timeline for development.

#### **Deployment Preferences**
- Cloud-based deployment using platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalability and reliability.
