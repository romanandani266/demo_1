---

### 13. **Assumptions**
- All users will have access to a stable internet connection.
- The system will be deployed on AWS Cloud hosting.
- The target audience will have basic technical knowledge to operate the system.

---

### 14. **Technical Requirements**
#### **System Capabilities**
1. **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**:
   - Use WebSocket or RESTful APIs to enable real-time updates of inventory levels.
   - Implement a centralized database (PostgreSQL) to store inventory data.
   - Enable multi-location tracking with unique identifiers for each location.

2. **Automated Restocking Alerts**:
   - Develop a rule-based engine to trigger alerts when stock levels fall below predefined thresholds.
   - Use email and SMS APIs (e.g., Twilio) for sending notifications.

3. **Sales Trend Analysis**:
   - Integrate analytics tools (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib) for generating sales trend reports.
   - Provide exportable reports in formats like CSV and PDF.

4. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Implement user authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Define user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Viewer) with specific access permissions.

5. **Data Security**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256 encryption.
   - Use HTTPS for secure communication between the client and server.

#### **Performance Requirements**
- The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- Real-time updates should reflect within 2 seconds of a change in inventory.
- The system should support up to 1 million inventory records without performance degradation.

#### **Scalability Requirements**
- Use AWS Auto Scaling to handle increased traffic during peak times.
- Design the database schema to support horizontal scaling.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Availability**: The system should have 99.9% uptime.
