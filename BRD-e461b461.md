- **Key Features:** Real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, sales trend analysis.
- **Expected Benefits:** Reduced stock shortages and overstocking, improved supply chain efficiency, better sales forecasting.
- **Primary Deliverables:** Web-based inventory tracking system, automated stock alert notifications.
- **Out of Scope:** Advanced AI-driven forecasting, mobile application development.
- **Preferred Platform:** Web-based application.
- **Programming Language:** Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Database Requirements:** PostgreSQL.
- **Security Requirements:** Role-based access control, encrypted data storage.
- **Known Constraints:** Budget limitations for advanced analytics, internet dependency for real-time tracking.
- **Deployment Preferences:** AWS Cloud hosting.
- **UI Requirements:** Minimalistic dashboard, easy navigation.
- **Competitors or References:** Coca-Cola’s retail inventory solutions, Unilever’s supply chain tools.

## System Architecture

- **Overall Architecture:** The system will be a web-based application using a client-server model. The front-end will be developed using React, while the back-end will be built with Python and Flask. The database will be PostgreSQL, hosted on AWS Cloud.
- **Components:** 
  - Front-end: React
  - Back-end: Python, Flask
  - Database: PostgreSQL
  - Hosting: AWS Cloud

## Integration Requirements

- **Integration Points:** Integration with external systems such as supplier databases and sales platforms.
- **Communication Protocols:** RESTful APIs for communication between components.
- **Data Formats:** JSON for data interchange.
- **Authentication Methods:** OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.

## Security Requirements

- **Encryption Protocols:** Use of TLS for data in transit and AES for data at rest.
- **Authentication:** Role-based access control with OAuth 2.0.
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow OWASP guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with GDPR for data protection.

## Performance and Scalability

- **Performance Goals:** 
  - Load: Support up to 10,000 concurrent users.
  - Response Times: Average response time should be less than 2 seconds.
- **Scalability Considerations:** 
  - Horizontal scaling for the web application.
  - Vertical scaling for the database.

## Data Storage and Management

- **Database Design:** Relational database design using PostgreSQL.
- **Data Retention Policies:** Data will be retained for a minimum of 5 years.
- **Migration Rules:** Data migration scripts will be developed for seamless transitions.

## Availability and Reliability

- **System Uptime Goals:** 99.9% uptime.
- **Failover Plans:** Implement AWS multi-zone failover strategies.
- **Backup Mechanisms:** Daily backups with AWS RDS automated backup.

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Tools:** Use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
- **Key Metrics:** System uptime, response times, error rates.

## Deployment and Version Control

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.
- **Version Control:** Use Git for version control.
- **Rollback Procedures:** Automated rollback procedures in case of deployment failures.
- **Environment Configurations:** Separate environments for development, testing, and production.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Testing Types:** 
  - Unit Testing
  - Integration Testing
  - Performance Testing
- **Automation Tools:** Use Selenium for automated testing.
- **Code Quality Standards:** Adhere to PEP 8 for Python code quality.

## Documentation Requirements

- **Technical Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation, system architecture diagrams, and user manuals will be provided.
