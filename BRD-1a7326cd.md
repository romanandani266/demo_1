## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking and restocking predictions.
- Minimize waste and optimize inventory levels.

#### Problem Statement
Retail businesses face challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. These issues result in lost sales opportunities and increased holding costs. The current manual processes are inefficient and prone to errors, necessitating an automated solution.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based application for inventory management.
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking within the first year.
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15% through better inventory tracking and forecasting.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application with real-time inventory tracking.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers.
- Measurable improvement in inventory management efficiency and sales forecasting accuracy.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking functionality.
- Automated restocking alerts based on predefined thresholds.
- Sales trend analysis for inventory forecasting.
- Web-based application interface with a minimalistic dashboard and easy navigation.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting features.
- Development of a mobile application.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will rely on internet connectivity for real-time tracking.
- Budget constraints may limit the implementation of advanced analytics features.
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels fall below a certain threshold.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the PepsiCo supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate additional users and data.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime for the web application.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection and privacy.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain management tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Implement Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to illustrate data movement within the system.
- **Data Storage**: Use PostgreSQL for secure and efficient data storage.
- **Data Management**: Ensure data integrity and consistency across all modules.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Develop wireframes for the main dashboard and key user interfaces.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map out user journeys to optimize the user experience.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Design a minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation and clear data visualization.
