# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

## **14. Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. This section outlines the applicable regulations, their requirements, and how the system will meet them. Additionally, security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls are documented to ensure compliance.

---

### **14.1 Applicable Regulations**

Based on the business requirements and the nature of the system, the following regulations are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU).
2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Applicable if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI) in the healthcare domain.
3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system processes payment card information.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system processes personal data of California residents.

### **14.2 Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

#### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

- **Key Requirements**:
  - Data Minimization: Collect only the data necessary for the purpose.
  - Lawful Basis for Processing: Ensure a valid legal basis for processing personal data.
  - Data Subject Rights: Provide mechanisms for data subjects to access, rectify, delete, or restrict their data.
  - Data Breach Notification: Notify authorities and affected individuals in case of a data breach.
  - Data Protection by Design and Default: Incorporate privacy measures into the system design.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Data Minimization**: Limit the fields in the `Users` table to only essential information (e.g., `email`, `name`, `role`).
  - **Consent Management**: Add a `consent` field in the `Users` table to track user consent for data processing.
  - **Data Subject Rights**: Implement API endpoints to handle requests for data access, rectification, and deletion.
  - **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive fields like `password` and `email` using industry-standard algorithms.
  - **Audit Logs**: Use the `Audit Logs` table to track access and modifications to personal data.
  - **Data Breach Notification**: Implement a notification system to alert administrators and users in case of a breach.

#### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

- **Key Requirements**:
  - Access Control: Restrict access to PHI based on roles.
  - Audit Controls: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
  - Data Encryption: Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.
  - Data Integrity: Ensure that PHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
  - Breach Notification: Notify affected individuals and authorities in case of a breach.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Access Control**: Use the `role` field in the `Users` table to enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
  - **Audit Logs**: Use the `Audit Logs` table to track all access and changes to PHI.
  - **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data fields in the database and use HTTPS for all API communications.
  - **Data Integrity**: Implement database constraints and triggers to prevent unauthorized changes to PHI.
  - **Breach Notification**: Extend the notification system to include HIPAA-compliant breach notifications.

#### **3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**

- **Key Requirements**:
  - Secure Storage: Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization.
  - Encryption: Encrypt cardholder data using strong cryptography.
  - Access Control: Restrict access to cardholder data on a need-to-know basis.
  - Monitoring and Testing: Regularly monitor and test networks for vulnerabilities.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Secure Storage**: Avoid storing sensitive payment data in the database.
  - **Encryption**: Use tokenization or encryption for any payment-related data.
  - **Access Control**: Use the `role` field in the `Users` table to restrict access to payment data.
  - **Monitoring**: Use the `Audit Logs` table to track access to payment data and implement regular security scans.

#### **4. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**

- **Key Requirements**:
  - Data Access: Allow users to request access to their personal data.
  - Data Deletion: Provide mechanisms for users to request data deletion.
  - Opt-Out: Allow users to opt out of the sale of their personal data.
  - Transparency: Provide clear privacy policies and disclosures.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Data Access and Deletion**: Implement API endpoints to handle user requests for data access and deletion.
  - **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Add a `data_sale_opt_out` field in the `Users` table to track opt-out preferences.
  - **Transparency**: Include a privacy policy link in the user interface and provide clear disclosures about data usage.

### **14.3 Security Measures**

1. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields like `password` and `email` in the `Users` table.
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
   - Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.

3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Use the `Audit Logs` table to track all access and modifications to sensitive data.
   - Include fields like `user_id`, `action`, `entity_id`, and `timestamp` for detailed logging.

4. **Data Masking**:
   - Mask sensitive data in logs and notifications to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate risks.

---

### **14.4 Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Retention**:
   - Define retention periods for personal data and implement automated deletion mechanisms.

2. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize data that is no longer needed for business purposes but must be retained for compliance.

3. **Consent Management**:
   - Track user consent for data processing in the `Users` table.

4. **Third-Party Data Sharing**:
   - Ensure that any data shared with third parties complies with applicable regulations and is covered by data processing agreements.

---

### **14.5 Audit Controls**

1. **Audit Log Table**:
   - Use the `Audit Logs` table to track all access and modifications to sensitive data.
   - Include fields like `log_id`, `user_id`, `action`, `entity_id`, and `timestamp`.

2. **Triggers**:
   - Implement triggers to automatically log changes to sensitive data in the `Audit Logs` table.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity.

---

### **14.6 Compliance Validation**

1. **During Implementation**:
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure compliance with encryption, access control, and data privacy requirements.
   - Perform security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

2. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Conduct regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulations.
   - Use automated tools to monitor for compliance violations.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain detailed documentation of compliance measures, including policies, procedures, and audit logs.
