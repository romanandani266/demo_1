### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

## **Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system will adhere to the applicable standards based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed.

---

### **1. Applicable Compliance Standards**

#### **1.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- **Applicability**: GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU).
- **Compliance Requirements**:
  - **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the system's functionality (e.g., user email, hashed passwords).
  - **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
  - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
  - **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
  - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
  - **Data Processing Agreements**: Ensure third-party vendors (e.g., AWS RDS) comply with GDPR.
- **Implementation in the System**:
  - Encrypt sensitive data such as `email` and `password_hash` in the `Users` table.
  - Implement a user interface for data access and deletion requests.
  - Log and monitor access to personal data for audit purposes.
  - Use AWS RDS encryption features for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.

#### **1.2 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**
- **Applicability**: HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). Based on the current BRD, this is not applicable unless the system is extended to handle health-related data.

#### **1.3 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**
- **Applicability**: PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information. Based on the current BRD, this is not applicable unless payment processing is integrated.

#### **1.4 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**
- **Applicability**: CCPA applies if the system processes personal data of California residents and meets certain thresholds (e.g., annual revenue, data volume).
- **Compliance Requirements**:
  - **Right to Know**: Inform users about the categories of personal data collected and its purpose.
  - **Right to Opt-Out**: Allow users to opt out of data selling (if applicable).
  - **Right to Delete**: Allow users to request data deletion.
  - **Non-Discrimination**: Ensure users are not discriminated against for exercising their rights.
- **Implementation in the System**:
  - Provide a privacy policy outlining data collection and usage.
  - Implement a mechanism for users to request data deletion.
  - Ensure compliance with non-discrimination rules in user management.

#### **1.5 Other Standards**
- **ISO/IEC 27001**: While not mandatory, adopting this standard for information security management can enhance the system's security posture.
- **SOC 2**: If the system is offered as a service, SOC 2 compliance can demonstrate trustworthiness in security, availability, and confidentiality.

### **2. Security Measures**

To meet the compliance requirements and ensure data security, the following measures will be implemented:

#### **2.1 Data Encryption**
- **At Rest**: Use AWS RDS encryption for all database tables.
- **In Transit**: Use TLS for all data transmitted between the client and server.

#### **2.2 Access Control**
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using the `Users` and `User Roles` tables.
- Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Viewer).

#### **2.3 Audit Logging**
- Log all access to sensitive data, including `email` and `password_hash`.
- Maintain logs for at least 12 months for audit purposes.

#### **2.4 Data Masking**
- Mask sensitive data (e.g., email) in logs and non-production environments.

#### **2.5 Regular Security Assessments**
- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
- Monitor for unauthorized access and unusual activity.

---

### **3. Data Privacy Rules**

#### **3.1 Data Retention**
- Retain user data only as long as necessary for business purposes.
- Automatically delete inactive user accounts after a specified period (e.g., 12 months).

#### **3.2 Data Anonymization**
- Anonymize personal data in analytics and reporting to prevent identification of individuals.

#### **3.3 Consent Management**
- Implement a consent management system to track user consent for data processing.

---

### **4. Audit Controls**

#### **4.1 Logging**
- Log all user actions, including login attempts, data access, and updates.
- Store logs in a secure, tamper-proof environment.

#### **4.2 Monitoring**
- Use AWS CloudWatch or similar tools to monitor system activity and detect anomalies.

#### **4.3 Reporting**
- Generate compliance reports for GDPR and CCPA on demand.
- Provide audit trails for data access and modifications.

---

### **5. Validation of Compliance**

#### **5.1 During Implementation**
- Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to identify and mitigate risks.
- Perform a compliance review with legal and security teams before deployment.

#### **5.2 After Implementation**
- Schedule regular compliance audits (e.g., quarterly or annually).
- Use automated tools to monitor compliance with GDPR and CCPA.
- Update policies and procedures as regulations evolve.

---

### **6. Integration with Database Schema**

The database schema will be updated to support compliance requirements:

#### **6.1 Users Table**
- Add a `consent_status` field (ENUM: Granted, Revoked) to track user consent.
- Add a `data_deletion_request` field (BOOLEAN, Default: FALSE) to flag accounts for deletion.

#### **6.2 Audit Logs Table**
- Create a new `Audit Logs` table to store user actions:
  - `log_id` (Primary Key, UUID)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key, UUID)
  - `action` (VARCHAR, Not Null)
  - `timestamp` (TIMESTAMP, Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

#### **6.3 Data Retention Policy**
- Implement triggers to automatically delete records flagged for deletion after a specified period.
