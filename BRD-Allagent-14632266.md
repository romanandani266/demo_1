### 9. Database Schema

To support the functionality of the Retail Inventory Management System, the following database schema is proposed. The schema is designed to be normalized to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity.

#### 9.1 Tables and Relationships

1. **Products**
   - **Fields**:
     - `product_id` (Primary Key, Integer, Auto-increment)
     - `name` (String, Not Null)
     - `category` (String, Not Null)
     - `initial_stock_level` (Integer, Not Null)
   - **Indexes**: Index on `category` for faster queries.

2. **Inventory**
   - **Fields**:
     - `inventory_id` (Primary Key, Integer, Auto-increment)
     - `product_id` (Foreign Key, Integer, References Products(product_id))
     - `current_stock_level` (Integer, Not Null)
     - `last_updated` (Timestamp, Not Null)
   - **Indexes**: Index on `product_id` for faster joins.

3. **Alerts**
   - **Fields**:
     - `alert_id` (Primary Key, Integer, Auto-increment)
     - `product_id` (Foreign Key, Integer, References Products(product_id))
     - `stock_threshold` (Integer, Not Null)
     - `is_active` (Boolean, Not Null)
   - **Indexes**: Index on `product_id` for faster joins.

4. **Sales**
   - **Fields**:
     - `sale_id` (Primary Key, Integer, Auto-increment)
     - `product_id` (Foreign Key, Integer, References Products(product_id))
     - `quantity_sold` (Integer, Not Null)

  - Trigger to deactivate alerts in the Alerts table when `current_stock_level` exceeds `stock_threshold`.

#### 9.3 Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Below is a visual representation of the database schema in the form of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

```
+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
