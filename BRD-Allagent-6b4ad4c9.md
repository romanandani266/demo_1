# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Project Name
**Retail Inventory Management System**

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The retail industry faces challenges in managing inventory efficiently, leading to overstocking, understocking, and waste. To address these issues, this project aims to develop a Retail Inventory Management System that provides real-time inventory tracking, predicts restocking needs, and minimizes waste. This system will empower retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers to make data-driven decisions and streamline inventory operations.

### 1.2 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the business requirements for the Retail Inventory Management System. It serves as a guide for stakeholders, developers, and project managers to ensure alignment on the project’s objectives, scope, and deliverables.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements
- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: The system must track stock levels in real-time and display updates instantly.
- **Automated Restocking Alerts**: Notifications should be sent to users when stock levels fall below a predefined threshold.
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: The system should analyze historical sales data to predict future inventory needs.

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Platform**: The system must be a web-based application accessible via modern web browsers.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage and management.
- **Security**: The system must ensure secure access to data, with role-based permissions for different user types (e.g., retail partners, supply chain team, warehouse managers).

### 4.3 User Interface Requirements
- The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, with dashboards for inventory tracking, alerts, and sales trends.
- The design should follow modern UI/UX principles to ensure ease of use.

### 4.4 Deployment Preferences
- The system should be deployed on a cloud-based infrastructure for scalability and reliability.
