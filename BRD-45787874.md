### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following functionalities:
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis

The system will be a web-based application designed to improve inventory management for retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers. The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting or mobile application development.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient inventory management system.
- Track product stock levels accurately.
- Predict restocking needs to minimize waste.
- Enhance supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail businesses face challenges in managing inventory effectively, leading to stock shortages, overstocking, and inefficient supply chain operations. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, resulting in increased operational costs and lost sales opportunities.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a real-time inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analyze sales trends to improve forecasting accuracy.
- Achieve a reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by 20% within the first year.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based inventory management system.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and supply chain team.
- Measurable improvement in inventory management efficiency.
- Achievement of project objectives within the allocated budget and timeline.
