## Retail Inventory Management System

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following functionalities:
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting or mobile application development.

#### Business Objectives
The key goals of the Retail Inventory Management System are:
- To track product stock levels efficiently
- To predict restocking needs accurately
- To minimize waste in the supply chain

#### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges with stock shortages and overstocking, leading to inefficiencies in the supply chain and poor sales forecasting. The existing systems do not provide real-time tracking or automated alerts, resulting in delayed responses to inventory needs.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Develop a web-based inventory tracking system
- Implement automated stock alert notifications
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15%
- Enhance sales forecasting accuracy by 10%

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application
- Real-time inventory tracking with a 95% accuracy rate
- Automated restocking alerts with a response time of less than 5 minutes
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis
- Web-based application development using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React
- Role-based access control and encrypted data storage

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting
- Mobile application development

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will rely on internet connectivity for real-time tracking.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- Deployment will be on AWS Cloud hosting.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time inventory levels so that I can make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low to prevent stockouts.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the PepsiCo supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to optimize inventory levels.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 2 seconds.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be minimalistic and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection and privacy.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for data exchange
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database and be accessible to authorized users.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**: [Include DFDs here]

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: [Include wireframes here]
- **User Journey Mapping**: [Include user journey maps here]
- **User Interface Specifications**: The dashboard should be minimalistic with easy navigation.

### 3. Project Execution & Management

#### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Design & Prototyping (4 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Development (8 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Testing (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Deployment & Training (2 weeks)

#### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $150,000
- **Personnel**: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Developers, QA Engineers, UI/UX Designers

#### Risk & Issue Management
- **Risk 1**: Internet dependency may affect real-time tracking. *Mitigation*: Implement offline data caching.
- **Risk 2**: Budget constraints may limit features. *Mitigation*: Prioritize essential features.

#### Change Management
- Any changes to the project scope must be approved by the project manager and stakeholders. A formal change request process will be followed.

### 4. Testing & Acceptance

#### Acceptance Criteria
- The system must meet all functional and non-functional requirements.
- Successful user acceptance testing by retail partners and warehouse managers.

#### Testing Criteria
- **Functional Testing**: Verify all functionalities work as intended.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system meets performance requirements.
- **Security Testing**: Test for vulnerabilities and ensure data protection.
- **Usability Testing**: Validate the user interface for ease of use.
