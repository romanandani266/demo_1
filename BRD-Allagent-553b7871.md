# Technical Requirements for the Retail Inventory Management System

This section outlines the technical requirements necessary to implement the "Retail Inventory Management System" as described in the Business Requirements Document (BRD). The technical requirements are categorized into functional and non-functional requirements, with additional considerations for performance, scalability, security, and integration.

---

## 1. System Capabilities and Architecture

### 1.1 System Capabilities
- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: The system must provide real-time updates on stock levels across multiple locations.
- **Automated Restocking Alerts**: Notifications should be triggered automatically when stock levels fall below predefined thresholds.
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: The system should analyze historical sales data to provide actionable insights for inventory planning.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different user roles (e.g., retail partners, supply chain team, warehouse managers) must have tailored access and permissions.
- **Cloud-Based Deployment**: The system must be hosted on a cloud platform to ensure scalability and accessibility.

### 1.2 System Architecture
- **Frontend**: A web-based user interface built using modern frameworks like React.js or Angular for responsiveness and usability.
- **Backend**: A RESTful API or GraphQL-based backend developed using Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), or Java (Spring Boot).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage, with support for indexing and querying large datasets.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for hosting, with services like EC2 (compute), RDS (database), and S3 (storage).
- **Integration Layer**: Middleware for seamless integration with existing PepsiCo systems and third-party tools (if required in the future).

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Real-Time Inventory Tracking
- **Data Synchronization**: The system must synchronize inventory data in real-time across all connected devices and locations.
- **Stock Level Monitoring**: Users should be able to view current stock levels, historical trends, and location-specific inventory data.
- **Search and Filter**: The system must allow users to search and filter inventory data by product, location, or category.

### 2.2 Automated Restocking Alerts
- **Threshold Configuration**: Users should be able to set custom stock thresholds for each product.
- **Notification Channels**: Alerts should be sent via email, SMS, or in-app notifications.
- **Alert Dashboard**: A centralized dashboard to view and manage all active alerts.

### 2.3 Sales Trend Analysis
- **Data Visualization**: The system must provide charts, graphs, and dashboards to visualize sales trends.
- **Predictive Insights**: Basic predictive analytics to forecast future inventory needs based on historical sales data.
- **Export Functionality**: Users should be able to export sales trend reports in formats like CSV or PDF.

### 2.4 User Management
- **Role-Based Access**: Different user roles with specific permissions (e.g., view-only, edit, admin).
- **User Authentication**: Secure login using OAuth 2.0 or SSO (Single Sign-On).
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of user activities for compliance and troubleshooting.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- **Response Time**: The system must respond to user actions within 2 seconds for 95% of requests.
- **Concurrent Users**: Support at least 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **Data Latency**: Real-time updates should have a latency of no more than 5 seconds.

### 3.2 Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: The system must support horizontal scaling to handle increased user load.
- **Database Scalability**: PostgreSQL must be configured for sharding or replication to manage large datasets.

### 3.3 Security
- **Data Encryption**: All data in transit and at rest must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2, AES-256).
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access based on user roles.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to PepsiCo’s security and compliance standards, including GDPR and CCPA (if applicable).

### 3.4 Integration
- **Existing Systems**: Ensure compatibility with PepsiCo’s existing IT infrastructure.
- **APIs**: Provide RESTful APIs for future integration with third-party systems.
- **Data Import/Export**: Support importing and exporting data in standard formats like CSV, JSON, and XML.

### 3.5 Availability
- **Uptime**: The system must have an uptime of 99.9% or higher.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Implement automated backups and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

### 3.6 Usability
- **User Interface**: The UI must be intuitive, with minimal learning curve for new users.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards for accessibility.

## 5. Performance, Scalability, and Security Considerations

### 5.1 Performance
- Optimize database queries using indexing and caching.
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce latency for static assets.

### 5.2 Scalability
- Implement auto-scaling groups in AWS to handle variable user loads.
- Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous processing.

### 5.3 Security
- Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts.
