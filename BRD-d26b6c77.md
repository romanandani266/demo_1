# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is created to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure that all parties have a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to be a reference throughout the project lifecycle to ensure alignment and successful project execution.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting. The system will be limited to the functionalities outlined in this document and will not include any features outside the defined scope.

### Business Objectives
- To streamline the software development process.
- To improve collaboration and communication among team members.
- To enhance project visibility and reporting.
- To ensure timely delivery of software projects.

### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges in managing software development projects due to a lack of centralized tools for collaboration, tracking, and reporting. This results in inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized system for managing software development projects.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20%.
- Increase team collaboration and communication efficiency by 30%.
- Provide real-time reporting and analytics for project status and performance.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of the system within the defined timeline and budget.
- Achieving the targeted reduction in project delivery time.
- Positive feedback from users regarding improved collaboration and communication.
- Accurate and timely reporting of project status and performance metrics.

- Known constraints will be managed to minimize impact on the project.

### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a project manager, I want to create and manage project plans so that I can allocate resources and track progress.
- **User Story 1**: As a developer, I want to update my task status so that the team is aware of my progress.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and data encryption.
- **Usability**: The system should have an intuitive user interface with minimal learning curve.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth.
- **Availability**: The system should have 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: The system should comply with relevant industry standards and regulations.

### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: To be determined based on preferred platform and programming language.
- **Architecture**: The system will follow a microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: The system will provide RESTful APIs for integration with third-party tools.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with tools such as JIRA, Slack, and GitHub.

### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow through the system via secure APIs and will be stored in a centralized database.
- **Data Storage**: The database will be designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- **Data Management**: Data will be managed in compliance with data protection regulations.

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Detailed wireframes will be provided for each major feature.
- **User Journey Mapping**: User journeys will be mapped to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **User Interface Specifications**: The UI will be designed to be responsive and accessible.

## 3. Project Execution & Management

### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering - 4 weeks
- **Phase 2**: Design - 6 weeks
- **Phase 3**: Development - 12 weeks
- **Phase 4**: Testing - 4 weeks
- **Phase 5**: Deployment - 2 weeks

### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $500,000
- **Personnel**: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Developers, QA Engineers, UI/UX Designers

### Risk & Issue Management
- **Risk 1**: Delays in requirements gathering - Mitigation: Regular stakeholder meetings.
- **Risk 2**: Technical challenges - Mitigation: Conduct technical feasibility studies.

### Change Management
