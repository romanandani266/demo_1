# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

## 1. Introduction

### Overview
The **Retail Inventory Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline inventory management for retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers. The system aims to provide real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis to optimize stock levels, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste.

## 2. Compliance and Regulatory Standards

### Overview
To ensure the system complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system will adhere to applicable regulations such as **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, and **PCI-DSS**, depending on the nature of the data being processed and stored. Below is a detailed breakdown of the compliance requirements and how the system will meet them.

---

### 2.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

#### Applicability
GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals located in the European Union (EU). This includes user data such as email addresses, usernames, and any other personally identifiable information (PII).

#### Compliance Requirements
1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data that is necessary for the system's functionality.
2. **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting their personal data.
3. **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
5. **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
6. **Data Processing Agreements**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with GDPR.

#### Implementation in the System
- **Data Minimization**: Limit user data collection to `username`, `email`, and `role`.
- **Consent Management**: Add a consent form during user registration.
- **Access and Erasure**: Provide a user interface for users to view and delete their data.
- **Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **Breach Notification**: Implement automated alerts for potential breaches and a notification system.
- **Vendor Compliance**: Include GDPR clauses in contracts with third-party service providers.

### 2.2 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

#### Applicability
HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). If the system is used in healthcare-related contexts, such as tracking medical supplies, HIPAA compliance is required.

#### Compliance Requirements
1. **Access Controls**: Restrict access to PHI based on user roles.
2. **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
3. **Data Integrity**: Ensure that PHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.
5. **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with HIPAA.

#### Implementation in the System
- **Access Controls**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Audit Controls**: Log all user actions related to PHI in an immutable audit trail.
- **Data Integrity**: Implement checksums and hashing to verify data integrity.
- **Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for PHI at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **BAAs**: Sign BAAs with all third-party vendors handling PHI.

### 2.3 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)

#### Applicability
PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information. If the system integrates with payment gateways for transactions, compliance is mandatory.

#### Compliance Requirements
1. **Secure Network**: Use firewalls and secure configurations to protect cardholder data.
2. **Data Protection**: Encrypt cardholder data both in transit and at rest.
3. **Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel only.
4. **Monitoring and Testing**: Regularly monitor and test networks for vulnerabilities.
5. **Incident Response**: Have a plan in place to respond to security incidents.

#### Implementation in the System
- **Secure Network**: Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
- **Data Protection**: Do not store cardholder data; use tokenization and integrate with PCI-compliant payment gateways.
- **Access Control**: Implement RBAC to restrict access to payment data.
- **Monitoring and Testing**: Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests.
- **Incident Response**: Develop and test an incident response plan.

## 3. Security Measures

### Overview
The following security measures will be implemented to ensure compliance with the above regulations and to protect the system from unauthorized access and data breaches.

### 3.1 Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: Use AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data stored in the database.
- **In Transit**: Use TLS 1.2+ for all data transmitted over the network.

### 3.2 Access Control
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.

### 3.3 Audit Controls
- Maintain an immutable audit trail of all user actions, including data access, modifications, and deletions.
- Store audit logs in a secure, tamper-proof location.

### 3.4 Data Privacy Rules
- Anonymize or pseudonymize data where possible to minimize the risk of exposure.
- Implement data retention policies to delete data that is no longer needed.

### 3.5 Incident Response
- Develop an incident response plan to handle data breaches and other security incidents.
- Conduct regular drills to test the effectiveness of the incident response plan.

## 4. Validation of Compliance

### During Implementation
1. **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to ensure compliance with security and privacy standards.
2. **Penetration Testing**: Perform penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
3. **Compliance Audits**: Engage third-party auditors to verify compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

### After Implementation
1. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the system for compliance violations and security threats.
2. **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic audits to ensure ongoing compliance.
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users to identify potential compliance issues.

## 5. Database Schema

### Overview
The database schema is designed to support the business logic and technical requirements outlined in the BRD. The schema is normalized to avoid redundancy and ensure data integrity. It includes tables for products, inventory, alerts, sales, and users, with appropriate relationships, constraints, and indexes.

[The database schema details remain unchanged and are included in the original BRD.]

This updated BRD ensures that the **Retail Inventory Management System** is not only robust and scalable but also compliant with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards.
