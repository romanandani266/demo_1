# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is created to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure that all parties have a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to be a reference throughout the project lifecycle to ensure alignment and successful project execution.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, including planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It will provide tools and functionalities to streamline these processes, improve collaboration, and enhance productivity. The system will not include hardware procurement or physical infrastructure management.

### Business Objectives
- Enhance the efficiency of the software development process.
- Improve collaboration among development teams.
- Ensure timely delivery of software projects.
- Provide a centralized platform for managing the software development life cycle.

### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges in managing the software development life cycle due to a lack of centralized tools and processes. This results in inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform for managing the entire software development process.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized platform for managing the software development life cycle.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20%.
- Increase team collaboration and communication by 30%.
- Improve project tracking and reporting capabilities.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of the system within the defined timeline and budget.
- Achieving the targeted reduction in project delivery time.
- Positive feedback from users regarding improved collaboration and communication.
- Accurate and timely project tracking and reporting.

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

### In-Scope Items
- Development of a centralized platform for managing the software development life cycle.
- Features for project planning, task management, and resource allocation.
- Tools for code versioning, testing, and deployment.
- Integration with existing tools and systems used by the development team.

### Out-of-Scope Items
- Hardware procurement and physical infrastructure management.
- Training and support for third-party tools not integrated into the system.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using the preferred platform and programming language specified by the client.
- The project will be completed within the allocated budget and timeline.

### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a project manager, I want to create and manage project plans to ensure timely delivery.
- **Use Case 2**: As a developer, I want to access code repositories and version control tools to manage code changes.
- **User Story 1**: As a tester, I want to execute test cases and report defects to ensure software quality.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **Security**: The system must comply with industry-standard security protocols to protect sensitive data.
- **Usability**: The system should have an intuitive user interface that requires minimal training.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth in users and data.

### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: The system will be developed using the preferred platform and programming language specified by the client.
- **Architecture**: The system will follow a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability.
- **API Requirements**: The system will provide RESTful APIs for integration with third-party tools.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: The system will integrate with existing tools used by the development team, such as code repositories and testing tools.

### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow seamlessly between different modules of the system to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Storage**: The system will use a relational database to store project data, user information, and other relevant data.
- **Data Management**: Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) will be used to illustrate how data is processed and managed within the system.

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Wireframes will be created to provide a visual representation of the user interface.
- **User Journey Mapping**: User journey maps will be developed to understand the user experience and identify areas for improvement.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Detailed specifications will be provided for the design and layout of the user interface.

## 3. Project Execution & Management

### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering and Analysis (4 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: System Design and Architecture (6 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Development and Implementation (12 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Testing and Quality Assurance (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Deployment and Go-Live (2 weeks)

### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $500,000
- **Required Personnel**: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Software Developers, QA Testers, UI/UX Designers

### Risk & Issue Management
- **Risk 1**: Delays in project delivery due to resource constraints. **Mitigation**: Allocate additional resources and prioritize tasks.
- **Risk 2**: Security vulnerabilities in the system. **Mitigation**: Conduct regular security audits and implement best practices.

### Change Management
- **Process**: Any changes to the project scope will be documented and reviewed by the project steering committee. Approval will be required before implementation.

## 4. Testing & Acceptance

### Acceptance Criteria
