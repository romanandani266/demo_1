## System Architecture

### Overall Architecture
- The system will be built using a microservices architecture to ensure modularity and scalability.
- Components include user authentication service, inventory management service, reporting service, and integration service.
- Technology stack: React for frontend, Node.js for backend, MongoDB for database, and AWS for hosting.

### Hosting Environment
- The system will be hosted on AWS, utilizing services such as EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, and RDS for database management.

## Integration Requirements
