# Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis

Limitations:
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting and mobile application development are out of scope.

### Business Objectives
The key goals of the Retail Inventory Management System are:
- To track product stock levels efficiently
- To predict restocking needs accurately
- To minimize waste in the supply chain

### Problem Statement
Retail partners and the PepsiCo supply chain team face challenges in managing inventory levels, leading to stock shortages and overstocking. This results in inefficiencies in the supply chain and impacts sales forecasting accuracy.

### Goals & Objectives
- Reduce stock shortages and overstocking by 30% within the first year of implementation.
- Improve supply chain efficiency by automating restocking alerts.
- Enhance sales forecasting accuracy by analyzing sales trends.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Implementation of automated stock alert notifications.
- Achieving a user satisfaction rate of 85% or higher among retail partners and warehouse managers.

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

### In-Scope Items
- Development of a web-based application for inventory tracking.
- Real-time inventory tracking functionality.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis features.

### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- The system will be hosted on AWS Cloud.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics capabilities.
- The system requires an internet connection for real-time tracking.

### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
#### Use Case 1: Real-Time Inventory Tracking
- **User Story**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels so that I can make informed decisions about inventory management.

#### Use Case 2: Automated Restocking Alerts
- **User Story**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low so that I can reorder products in a timely manner.

#### Use Case 3: Sales Trend Analysis
- **User Story**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to improve sales forecasting and inventory planning.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
