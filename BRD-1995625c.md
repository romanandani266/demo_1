# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is created to outline the requirements and expectations for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a reference point throughout the project lifecycle.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting. The system will be limited to the functionalities outlined in this document and will not include any additional features not specified herein.

### Business Objectives
- Streamline the software development process to improve efficiency and productivity.
- Enhance collaboration and communication among team members.
- Provide real-time tracking and reporting of project progress.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices.

### Problem Statement
The current software development process is fragmented and lacks a centralized system for managing projects. This leads to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery. The new system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform for managing the entire software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized system for managing software development projects.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20% within the first year of implementation.
- Increase team collaboration and communication by providing integrated tools.
- Achieve a user satisfaction rate of 90% or higher.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of the system within the specified timeline and budget.
- Achievement of the defined goals and objectives.
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Measurable improvements in project delivery time and team collaboration.
