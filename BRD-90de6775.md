## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for the design, development, and implementation of the system.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The system will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient inventory management system.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking.
- Minimize waste through better inventory management.
- Improve supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and warehouse managers face challenges in maintaining optimal stock levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies in the supply chain and impacts sales forecasting accuracy. The current systems lack real-time tracking and automated alerts, making it difficult to respond promptly to inventory needs.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.
- Achieve a reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by 20% within the first year.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all stakeholders.
- Real-time inventory tracking with a 95% accuracy rate.
- Automated restocking alerts reducing manual intervention by 50%.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers on system usability.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking functionality.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis tools.
- Web-based user interface with a minimalistic dashboard.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- The system requires an internet connection for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels fall below a certain threshold.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and require minimal training.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional retail partners.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture for scalability.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database, with real-time updates.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) will be provided to illustrate data movement.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Include wireframes for the dashboard and key interfaces.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map out the user journey from login to inventory management.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Ensure a minimalistic design with easy navigation.
