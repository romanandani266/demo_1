## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for the design, development, and implementation of the system.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking and restocking predictions.
- Minimize waste and reduce stock shortages and overstocking.

#### Problem Statement
Retail businesses face challenges in managing inventory effectively, leading to stock shortages, overstocking, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, resulting in lost sales opportunities and increased operational costs.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking within the first year.
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15% through better sales forecasting.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all target users.
- Real-time inventory tracking with a 95% accuracy rate.
- Automated restocking alerts with a response time of less than 5 minutes.
- Positive feedback from at least 80% of users regarding system usability and efficiency.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking functionality.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis tools.
- Web-based user interface with a minimalistic dashboard.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- The project is constrained by budget limitations for advanced analytics.
- Internet connectivity is required for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels fall below a certain threshold.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the PepsiCo supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 2 seconds.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to accommodate additional features.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection and privacy.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain management tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database, where it will be processed and analyzed.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Implement data flow diagrams (DFDs) to visualize data movement.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Develop wireframes for the dashboard and key interfaces.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map out user interactions to ensure a seamless experience.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Design a minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation.
