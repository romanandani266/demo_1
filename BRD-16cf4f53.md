# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is created to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication, set expectations, and provide a basis for project planning and execution.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting. The system will be limited to the functionalities outlined in this document and will not include any features outside the defined scope.

### Business Objectives
- Enhance project management efficiency.
- Improve collaboration among team members.
- Streamline the software development process.
- Provide real-time reporting and analytics.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards.

### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges in managing software development projects due to a lack of centralized tools and inefficient communication channels. This results in delays, increased costs, and reduced productivity. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform for managing the software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized project management system.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20%.

- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: None specified.

### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from user input to the database and back to the user interface.
- **Storage**: Data will be stored in a relational database.
- **Management**: Data will be managed through a centralized database management system.

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: To be developed during the design phase.
- **User Journey Mapping**: To be conducted to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **User Interface Specifications**: To be defined based on user requirements.

## 3. Project Execution & Management

### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering - 2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: Design - 4 weeks
- **Phase 3**: Development - 8 weeks
- **Phase 4**: Testing - 4 weeks
- **Phase 5**: Deployment - 2 weeks

### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $200,000
- **Required Personnel**: Project Manager, Developers, QA Engineers, UI/UX Designers

### Risk & Issue Management
- **Potential Risks**: Delays in development, resource unavailability
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Regular progress reviews, contingency planning

### Change Management
- **Process**: Any changes to the project scope must be approved by the project manager and stakeholders.

## 4. Testing & Acceptance

### Acceptance Criteria
- All in-scope features are implemented and functional.
- The system meets performance and security requirements.
- Positive user feedback during the testing phase.

### Testing Criteria
- **Functional Testing**: Verify all functionalities work as intended.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system can handle the expected load.
- **Security Testing**: Conduct vulnerability assessments.
- **Usability Testing**: Gather user feedback on the interface and experience.
