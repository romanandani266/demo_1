### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for the design, development, and implementation of the system.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking and restocking predictions.
- Minimize waste and reduce stock shortages and overstocking.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and supply chain teams face challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels, leading to either stock shortages or overstocking. These issues result in lost sales opportunities and increased holding costs. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, which hampers efficient inventory management.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all stakeholders.
- Reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by at least 20%.
- Improved supply chain efficiency and better sales forecasting accuracy.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- The system will rely on internet connectivity for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels so that I can make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low to prevent stockouts.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection and privacy.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database, where it will be processed and analyzed.
- **Storage**: Data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Management**: Implement data flow diagrams (DFDs) to visualize data movement.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Develop wireframes for the minimalistic dashboard.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map out user interactions to ensure a seamless experience.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Design a clean and easy-to-navigate interface.
