## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for the design, development, and implementation of the system.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking and restocking predictions.
- Minimize waste and optimize inventory levels.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and supply chain teams face challenges in managing inventory efficiently, leading to stock shortages, overstocking, and increased waste. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, resulting in inefficiencies and lost sales opportunities.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated notifications for restocking.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all stakeholders.
- Reduction in stock shortages and overstocking incidents.
- Improved supply chain efficiency and sales forecasting accuracy.
