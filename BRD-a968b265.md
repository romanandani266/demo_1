# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Retail Inventory Management System

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for project stakeholders, developers, and business managers throughout the software development life cycle. It ensures that all parties have a clear understanding of the system's objectives, scope, and requirements.

#### Scope of the Project
The project aims to develop a web-based inventory management system that tracks product stock levels, predicts restocking needs, and minimizes waste. The system will include functionalities such as real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis. Integrations with third-party services, such as PepsiCo’s supply chain system, will be considered. Advanced AI-driven forecasting and mobile application development are out of scope for this project.

#### Business Objectives
- Improve inventory visibility and accuracy.
- Enhance decision-making with real-time data.
- Enable seamless user authentication and role-based access control.

#### Problem Statement
The current inventory management processes face challenges such as inefficiencies in tracking inventory, difficulties in managing sales trends, and security vulnerabilities in user authentication. The new system aims to address these issues by providing a streamlined and secure platform for inventory management.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Reduce stockouts by 20%.
- Provide real-time analytics for better decision-making.
- Improve inventory accuracy by 15%.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Response time for user interactions should be under 2 seconds.
- Inventory tracking accuracy should be above 95%.
- User adoption rate should reach 80% within the first six months.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- User Authentication & Management: User registration, login, role-based access control (Admin, Warehouse Manager, Retail Partner), and secure JWT-based authentication.
- Inventory Management: Product CRUD operations, displaying stock levels, handling low-stock alerts, and product categorization.
- Reporting & Sales Analytics: Dashboard with sales trends, graphical reports, and the ability to generate sales reports.
- Integration with External Systems: Frontend consumption of backend APIs for data retrieval (e.g., inventory data, sales data).

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- The system will be hosted on AWS Cloud.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- Internet dependency for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements
- **User Authentication & Management**: Secure JWT-based authentication, role-based access control.
- **Inventory Management**: CRUD operations, stock level display, low-stock alerts.
- **Reporting & Sales Analytics**: Sales trends dashboard, graphical reports.
- **Frontend**:
  - API Endpoints Consumption: `/auth/register`, `/products`.
  - UI Components & Pages: Authentication Pages, Dashboard, Inventory Management, Sales Reports.
  - Security & Performance Considerations: Secure API calls, responsive design.
  - Deployment & Hosting: AWS Cloud, CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
  - Success Metrics: Fast, responsive UI, seamless backend integration.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Handle 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Secure API calls, encrypted data, role-based access control.
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based deployment with horizontal scaling.

#### Technical Requirements
- Technology Stack: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, Material-UI, Axios.
- Third-party Integrations: PepsiCo’s supply chain system.

#### Data Management
Data will flow through secure APIs, stored in PostgreSQL, and managed with Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs).

#### UI/UX Requirements
- Responsive design for cross-device compatibility.
- Wireframes for key pages: Login, Inventory Management, Dashboard.
- User journey mapping for improved usability.

### 3. Project Execution & Management

#### Timeline & Milestones
- Requirements Gathering: 2 weeks
- Design: 3 weeks
- Development: 8 weeks
- Testing: 4 weeks

- Key Milestones: Prototype completion, User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

#### Budget & Resources
- Estimated Budget: $150,000
- Team Roles: Frontend Developers, UI/UX Designers, Project Managers.

#### Risk & Issue Management
- Potential Risks: Data synchronization issues, API performance bottlenecks.
- Mitigation Strategies: Regular testing, performance monitoring.

#### Change Management
- Process for handling changes: Documentation and approval required before implementation.

### 4. Testing & Acceptance

#### Acceptance Criteria
- System meets performance benchmarks.
- Passes security tests.
- User-friendly interface.

#### Testing Criteria
- **Functional Testing**: Ensure each feature works as intended.
- **Performance Testing**: Verify frontend handles large traffic.
- **Security Testing**: Ensure JWT tokens are secure, data encryption.
