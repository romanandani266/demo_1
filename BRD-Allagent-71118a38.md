### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

### 19. **Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System (RIMS) complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system must adhere to data privacy, security, and audit requirements based on the applicable regulations.

---

#### **Applicable Regulations**

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - **Applicability**: GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU).  
   - **Relevant Data**: User data such as `username`, `email`, and `password_hash`.

2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
   - **Applicability**: PCI-DSS applies if the system processes, stores, or transmits payment card information.  
   - **Relevant Data**: Although the current schema does not include payment card data, future integrations with payment systems may require compliance.

3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
   - **Applicability**: HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI).  
   - **Relevant Data**: Not applicable to the current system unless expanded to include health-related data.

4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  
   - **Applicability**: CCPA applies if the system processes personal data of California residents and meets certain thresholds (e.g., annual revenue, data volume).  
   - **Relevant Data**: User data such as `username`, `email`, and `password_hash`.

#### **Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

1. **GDPR Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Data minimization: Only collect and store necessary personal data.
     - Data protection: Implement technical and organizational measures to secure personal data.
     - Right to access and erasure: Allow users to access and delete their data upon request.
     - Data breach notification: Notify authorities and affected users in case of a data breach.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Encrypt sensitive data such as `password_hash` and `email`.
     - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to personal data.
     - Provide a user interface for data access and deletion requests.
     - Maintain an incident response plan for data breaches.

2. **PCI-DSS Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Secure storage of payment card data (if applicable).
     - Encrypt transmission of sensitive data over public networks.
     - Regularly test security systems and processes.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Although payment card data is not currently stored, ensure future integrations with payment systems comply with PCI-DSS.
     - Use HTTPS for all data transmissions.
     - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

3. **CCPA Compliance**
   - **Requirements**:
     - Provide transparency about data collection and usage.
     - Allow users to opt out of data selling (if applicable).
     - Enable users to request access to or deletion of their data.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Update the privacy policy to include details about data collection and usage.
     - Implement a mechanism for users to opt out of data sharing.
     - Provide a user interface for data access and deletion requests.

---

#### **Security Measures**

1. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt sensitive fields such as `password_hash` and `email` using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.2+ for data in transit).

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the `Roles` table to restrict access to sensitive data and system functionalities.

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Maintain logs of all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
   - Store logs securely and ensure they are tamper-proof.

4. **Incident Response**
   - Develop and document an incident response plan to handle data breaches and security incidents.
   - Conduct regular training for staff on data protection and security best practices.

---

#### **Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Retention**
   - Define and enforce data retention policies to delete or anonymize personal data after a specified period.

2. **User Consent**
   - Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting or processing their personal data.

3. **Data Anonymization**
   - Anonymize data used for analytics or trend analysis to protect user privacy.

---

#### **Audit Controls**

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Conduct regular internal and external audits to ensure compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.

2. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Implement monitoring tools to detect unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
   - Set up alerts for critical events such as failed login attempts or data breaches.

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain detailed documentation of compliance measures, including policies, procedures, and audit logs.

---

#### **Validation of Compliance**

1. **During Implementation**
   - Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to identify and mitigate privacy risks.
   - Perform security testing, including vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
   - Review the system design and database schema for compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.

2. **Post-Implementation**
   - Schedule regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulations.
   - Monitor system logs and alerts for potential compliance violations.
   - Update policies and procedures as regulations evolve.
