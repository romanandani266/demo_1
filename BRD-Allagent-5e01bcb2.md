# Project Requirements

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following updates and additions will be made to the Business Requirements Document (BRD):

---

## **8. Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

### **8.1 Overview**
The solution must comply with applicable regulatory and compliance standards to ensure data security, privacy, and integrity. This section outlines the relevant standards, their requirements, and how the system will meet them.

---

### **8.2 Applicable Compliance Standards**
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the solution, the following compliance standards are applicable:

#### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- **Applicability**: The solution will handle personal data of users, including email addresses, usernames, and other identifiable information.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the specified purpose.
  - **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
  - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
  - **Data Breach Notification**: Notify users and authorities within 72 hours of a data breach.
  - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data at rest and in transit.
- **Implementation**:
  - Implement a consent management module for user data collection.
  - Provide a user interface for accessing and deleting personal data.
  - Use encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) for data storage and TLS for data transmission.
  - Set up automated breach detection and notification mechanisms.

#### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** *(if applicable to the business domain)*:
- **Applicability**: If the solution processes Protected Health Information (PHI).
- **Key Requirements**:
  - **Access Control**: Implement role-based access to PHI.
  - **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
  - **Data Integrity**: Ensure that PHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
  - **Transmission Security**: Protect PHI during electronic transmission.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the `Users` table to enforce role-based access control.
  - Log all access and modifications in a dedicated audit table.
  - Use hashing and encryption to ensure data integrity and secure transmission.

#### **3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)** *(if payment processing is involved)*:
- **Applicability**: If the solution processes payment card information.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - **Secure Storage**: Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization.
  - **Access Restrictions**: Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel.
  - **Encryption**: Encrypt cardholder data during storage and transmission.
  - **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly test and monitor the system for vulnerabilities.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use third-party payment gateways to avoid storing sensitive cardholder data.
  - Encrypt all payment-related data using industry-standard encryption methods.
  - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

#### **4. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** *(if applicable)*:
- **Applicability**: If the solution serves users in California.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - **Data Transparency**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
  - **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Allow users to opt out of data selling or sharing.
  - **Data Access and Deletion**: Provide users with access to their data and the ability to delete it.
- **Implementation**:
  - Update the privacy policy to include detailed information about data collection.
  - Add an opt-out mechanism to the user interface.
  - Extend the GDPR-compliant data access and deletion features to meet CCPA requirements.

---

### **8.3 Security Measures**
To ensure compliance with the above standards, the following security measures will be implemented:
- **Data Encryption**: Use AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the `Users` table.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain detailed logs of all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and test an incident response plan to handle data breaches.

---

### **8.4 Data Privacy Rules**
The solution will adhere to the following data privacy principles:
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data will only be used for the purposes explicitly stated in the privacy policy.
- **Data Retention**: Personal data will be retained only as long as necessary and will be securely deleted thereafter.
- **User Rights**: Users will have the right to access, modify, and delete their data.

---

### **8.5 Audit Controls**
The following audit controls will be incorporated:
- **Access Logs**: Track all access to sensitive data, including timestamps and user IDs.
- **Modification Logs**: Record all changes to data, including the old and new values.
- **System Logs**: Monitor system activities, including API calls and database queries.

---

### **8.6 Compliance Validation**
To validate compliance during and after implementation:
1. **Pre-Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance gap analysis to identify and address any deficiencies.
   - Review the database schema and application architecture for compliance alignment.
2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Perform regular code reviews to ensure adherence to security and compliance standards.
   - Test the system against compliance checklists for GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.
3. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Conduct third-party audits to verify compliance.
   - Implement continuous monitoring to detect and address compliance violations.
   - Provide training to employees on compliance requirements and best practices.

---

### **8.7 Documentation**
All compliance-related activities, including risk assessments, security audits, and incident reports, will be documented and stored securely for future reference.
