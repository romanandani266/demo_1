## Project Name: Retail Inventory Management System

---

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for developing a Retail Inventory Management System. This document will serve as a guide for project stakeholders, developers, and business managers throughout the software development life cycle, ensuring that the project meets its objectives and delivers value to its users.

### Scope of the Project
The project aims to develop a web-based application for managing retail inventory efficiently. The system will include functionalities such as real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis. Integrations with third-party services, such as PepsiCo’s supply chain system, will be included. Advanced AI-driven forecasting and mobile application development are out of scope for this project.

### Business Objectives
- Improve inventory visibility and accuracy.
- Enhance decision-making with real-time data.
- Enable seamless user authentication and role-based access control.

### Problem Statement
The current inventory management processes face challenges such as inefficiencies in tracking inventory, difficulties in managing sales trends, and security vulnerabilities in user authentication.

### Goals & Objectives
- Reduce stockouts by 20%.
- Provide real-time analytics for better decision-making.
- Improve inventory accuracy by 30%.

### Key Success Criteria
- Response time for user interactions should be under 2 seconds.
- Inventory tracking accuracy should be above 95%.
- User adoption rates should exceed 80% within the first six months.

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

### In-Scope Items
- User Authentication & Management: Secure JWT-based authentication, user registration, login, and role-based access control.
- Inventory Management: Product CRUD operations, stock level display, low-stock alerts, and product categorization.
- Reporting & Sales Analytics: Dashboard with sales trends, graphical reports, and sales report generation.
- Integration with External Systems: Frontend consumption of backend APIs for data retrieval.

### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced predictive analytics.
- Mobile application development.

### Assumptions & Constraints
