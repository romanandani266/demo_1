### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

### 18. **Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system will adhere to the applicable standards based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed.

---

#### **Applicable Compliance Standards**

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - **Applicability**: The system may process personal data of users (e.g., usernames, emails, and roles) and potentially customer data if integrated with sales systems in the future. GDPR applies to any organization handling personal data of EU citizens.
   - **Compliance Requirements**:
     - **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the system's functionality.
     - **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
     - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
     - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
     - **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
   - **Implementation in the System**:
     - Encrypt sensitive fields like `password_hash` and `email` in the `Users` table.
     - Provide a user interface for managing consent and data deletion requests.
     - Implement audit logs to track data access and modifications.
     - Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
     - Develop a data breach response plan.

2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
   - **Applicability**: If the system integrates with payment processing in the future, PCI-DSS compliance will be required.
   - **Compliance Requirements**:
     - **Secure Payment Data**: Ensure that payment data is encrypted and stored securely.
     - **Access Control**: Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
     - **Regular Security Testing**: Conduct vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
   - **Implementation in the System**:
     - Currently, no payment data is processed. If added, a separate secure module will be developed for payment processing.
     - Role-based access control (RBAC) will be extended to payment-related data.

3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
   - **Applicability**: Not applicable unless the system processes health-related data.
   - **Compliance Requirements**: N/A.

4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  
   - **Applicability**: If the system processes personal data of California residents, CCPA compliance is required.
   - **Compliance Requirements**:
     - **Data Transparency**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
     - **Opt-Out Options**: Allow users to opt out of data sharing.
     - **Data Deletion**: Provide users with the ability to request data deletion.
   - **Implementation in the System**:
     - Include a privacy policy outlining data collection and usage.
     - Provide an opt-out mechanism for data sharing.
     - Extend GDPR-compliant data deletion features to meet CCPA requirements.

#### **Security Measures**

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
   - Ensure that only authorized users can access specific features based on their roles (e.g., admin, manager, viewer).
   - Implement role-based restrictions in the `Users` table using the `role` field.

2. **Data Encryption**  
   - Encrypt sensitive data fields such as `password_hash` and `email` in the `Users` table.
   - Use TLS/SSL for secure data transmission.

3. **Audit Logs**  
   - Maintain logs of all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
   - Store logs securely and ensure they are tamper-proof.

4. **Secure Authentication**  
   - Use hashed and salted passwords for user authentication.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users.

5. **Regular Security Testing**  
   - Conduct vulnerability scans and penetration testing to identify and mitigate security risks.

---

#### **Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Minimization**  
   - Collect only the data necessary for the system's functionality (e.g., username, email, role).

2. **Data Retention Policy**  
   - Define a retention period for user data and sales data. Automatically delete data that exceeds the retention period unless required for legal or business purposes.

3. **User Consent**  
   - Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
   - Provide a mechanism for users to withdraw consent.

4. **Data Access and Deletion**  
   - Allow users to access their data and request its deletion through the user interface.

---

#### **Audit Controls**

1. **Access Logs**  
   - Log all access to sensitive data, including the user ID, timestamp, and action performed.

2. **Change Logs**  
   - Maintain a record of all changes made to the database, including updates to inventory levels, user roles, and sales data.

3. **Periodic Audits**  
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and internal policies.

---

#### **Validation of Compliance**

1. **During Implementation**:
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable standards.
   - Perform security testing, including vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
   - Validate encryption mechanisms for data at rest and in transit.

2. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Conduct regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulatory standards.
   - Monitor system logs for unauthorized access or suspicious activities.
   - Update the system to address changes in regulatory requirements.

### 19. **Conclusion**

The Retail Inventory Management System will comply with GDPR, CCPA, and PCI-DSS (if applicable) to ensure data privacy and security. The outlined security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls will be incorporated into the system to meet compliance requirements. Regular validation during and after implementation will ensure the system remains compliant with evolving regulatory standards.
