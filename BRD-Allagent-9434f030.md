## Project Name: Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. **Introduction**
The Retail Inventory Management System project aims to develop a simple and efficient solution for tracking product stock levels, predicting restocking needs, and minimizing waste. This system is designed to address the challenges faced by retail partners, supply chain teams, and warehouse managers in managing inventory effectively. By leveraging modern technologies, the system will provide real-time insights and automated alerts to streamline inventory management processes.

### 2. **Business Objectives**
The primary objective of this project is to create a web-based inventory management system that:
- Tracks product stock levels in real-time.
- Predicts restocking needs based on sales trends and inventory data.
- Minimizes waste by optimizing stock levels and reducing overstocking or shortages.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time inventory tracking.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis.

**Expected Benefits:**
- Reduced stock shortages and overstocking.
- Improved supply chain efficiency.
- Enhanced sales forecasting capabilities.

### 4. **Requirements**

#### **Functional Requirements:**
1. **Inventory Tracking:** 
   - The system must provide real-time updates on stock levels.
   - Users should be able to view inventory by product, category, and location.
2. **Automated Alerts:** 
   - Notifications should be sent to relevant stakeholders when stock levels reach predefined thresholds.
   - Alerts should be configurable based on product type and location.
3. **Sales Analysis:** 
   - The system should analyze sales trends to predict restocking needs.
   - Historical sales data should be used to generate reports and insights.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**
1. **Platform:** 
   - The system will be a web-based application accessible via modern browsers.
2. **Programming Language:** 
   - Backend: Python (Flask framework).
   - Frontend: React.js for a responsive and interactive user interface.
3. **Database:** 
   - PostgreSQL for secure and scalable data storage.
4. **Security:** 
   - Role-based access control to ensure only authorized users can access specific features.
   - Encrypted data storage to protect sensitive information.
5. **Deployment:** 
   - AWS Cloud hosting for scalability, reliability, and high availability.
6. **UI/UX:** 
   - A minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation and intuitive design.
7. **Performance:** 
   - The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
8. **Scalability:** 
   - The architecture should support future enhancements, such as mobile app integration or advanced analytics.

#### **Database Requirements:**
- PostgreSQL will store:
  - Inventory data (product ID, stock levels, location, etc.).
  - Sales trends and historical data.
  - User information and access roles.
- Data integrity and consistency must be maintained across all tables.

#### **Security Requirements:**
- Role-based access control to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., admin, manager, staff).
- Encrypted data storage using AES-256 encryption for sensitive information.
- Secure communication using HTTPS and SSL/TLS protocols.

### 5. **Technical Requirements**

#### **System Capabilities:**
1. **Real-Time Data Processing:**
   - Use WebSocket or RESTful APIs to provide real-time updates on inventory levels.
2. **Notification System:**
   - Implement an email and SMS notification system using third-party services like Twilio or AWS SNS.
3. **Data Analytics:**
   - Use Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for sales trend analysis.
   - Generate visual reports using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly.
4. **Integration:**
   - Integrate with existing ERP systems via APIs for seamless data exchange.
   - Support CSV import/export for bulk data operations.

#### **Technologies and Tools:**
- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux (for state management), Bootstrap (for UI components).
- **Backend:** Python (Flask framework), Gunicorn (for WSGI server).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **Hosting:** AWS (EC2 for compute, RDS for database, S3 for static assets).
- **Version Control:** GitHub for source code management.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch for performance monitoring and logging.

#### **Performance Considerations:**
- Optimize database queries using indexing and caching (e.g., Redis).
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster asset delivery.
- Implement load balancing using AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

#### **Scalability Considerations:**
- Use containerization (Docker) for consistent deployment across environments.
- Implement auto-scaling on AWS to handle traffic spikes.

#### **Security Considerations:**
- Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users.
- Use AWS IAM roles and policies for secure access to cloud resources.

#### **Integration Considerations:**
- Ensure compatibility with existing ERP systems and third-party tools.
- Provide RESTful APIs for external integrations.
- Use middleware for data transformation and validation during integration.
