# Project Requirements

# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Project Name: Retail Inventory Management System

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for developing a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for project stakeholders, developers, and business managers throughout the software development life cycle. It ensures that all parties have a clear understanding of the system's purpose, scope, and functional specifications.

#### Scope of the Project
The project aims to develop a web-based application for managing retail inventory efficiently. The system will include functionalities such as real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis. Integrations with third-party services, such as PepsiCo’s supply chain system, will be included. Advanced AI-driven forecasting and mobile application development are out of scope for this project.

#### Business Objectives
- Improve inventory visibility and accuracy.
- Enhance decision-making with real-time data.
- Enable seamless user authentication and role-based access control.

#### Problem Statement
The current inventory management processes face challenges such as inefficiencies in tracking inventory, difficulties in managing sales trends, and security vulnerabilities in user authentication.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Reduce stockouts by 20%.
- Provide real-time analytics for better decision-making.
- Improve inventory accuracy by 30%.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Response time for user interactions should be under 2 seconds.
- Inventory tracking accuracy should be above 95%.
- User adoption rates should reach 80% within the first six months.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- User Authentication & Management: User registration, login, role-based access control (Admin, Warehouse Manager, Retail Partner), and secure JWT-based authentication.
- Inventory Management: Product CRUD operations, displaying stock levels, handling low-stock alerts, and product categorization.
- Reporting & Sales Analytics: Dashboard with sales trends, graphical reports, and the ability to generate sales reports.
- Integration with External Systems: Frontend consumption of backend APIs for data retrieval (e.g., inventory data, sales data).

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- The application will be hosted on AWS Cloud.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- Internet dependency for real-time tracking.
