# Project Requirements

To ensure the **Retail Inventory Management System** complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following updates and additions are made to the Business Requirements Document (BRD). These updates include identifying applicable compliance standards, outlining their requirements, and specifying how the system will meet them. Security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls are also documented, along with instructions for validating compliance during and after implementation.

## 11. Regulatory and Compliance Standards

### 11.1 Applicable Compliance Standards
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the system, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the collection and processing of personal data (e.g., user information, email addresses).
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system processes or stores payment card information.
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Applicable only if the system handles Protected Health Information (PHI). (Not applicable unless explicitly stated in the business requirements.)
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system serves California residents and meets the CCPA thresholds for data collection.
5. **Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)**: Applicable if the system is used by publicly traded companies and involves financial reporting.

### 11.2 Compliance Requirements and Implementation

#### 11.2.1 GDPR Compliance
- **Requirements**:
  - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
  - Provide users with the right to access, rectify, and delete their data.
  - Ensure data is stored securely and only for as long as necessary.
  - Notify users and authorities in case of a data breach.
- **Implementation**:
  - Add a consent mechanism during user registration.
  - Implement a "My Data" portal for users to view, update, and delete their data.
  - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`, `email`) in the database.
  - Use pseudonymization for data used in analytics.
  - Implement a breach notification system to alert users and authorities within 72 hours.

#### 11.2.2 PCI-DSS Compliance
- **Requirements**:
  - Encrypt payment card data during transmission and storage.
  - Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel only.
  - Regularly test and monitor security systems.
  - Maintain a secure network and firewall configuration.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use tokenization for payment card data storage.
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
  - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
  - Use HTTPS for all data transmissions.

#### 11.2.3 CCPA Compliance
- **Requirements**:
  - Provide users with the right to know what data is collected and how it is used.
  - Allow users to opt out of data selling (if applicable).
  - Delete user data upon request.
  - Include a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link on the website.
- **Implementation**:
  - Update the privacy policy to include CCPA-specific disclosures.
  - Add a "Do Not Sell My Data" option in the user settings.
  - Implement a data deletion workflow to handle user requests.

#### 11.2.4 SOX Compliance
- **Requirements**:
  - Maintain accurate and auditable financial records.
  - Implement controls to prevent unauthorized access to financial data.
  - Ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the `Logs` table to track all financial transactions and user actions.
  - Implement database-level constraints to ensure data integrity.
  - Conduct regular audits of financial records.

### 11.3 Security Measures
To meet the compliance requirements, the following security measures will be implemented:
1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest.
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit.
2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement RBAC to restrict access based on user roles (`admin`, `manager`, `user`).
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.
3. **Audit Logs**:
   - Log all user actions, including login attempts, data modifications, and access to sensitive data.
   - Store logs in a tamper-proof format.
4. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for the system's operation.
   - Regularly review and delete outdated or unnecessary data.
5. **Incident Response**:
   - Develop an incident response plan to handle data breaches and security incidents.
   - Conduct regular drills to test the plan.

---

### 11.4 Data Privacy Rules
1. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
   - Provide clear and concise information about data usage.
2. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain data only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose.
   - Implement automated data deletion policies.
3. **Data Access**:
   - Allow users to access, update, and delete their data through a self-service portal.
   - Restrict access to sensitive data to authorized personnel only.

---

### 11.5 Audit Controls
1. **Audit Trails**:
   - Use the `Logs` table to maintain a complete audit trail of user actions and system events.
   - Include details such as `user_id`, `action`, `timestamp`, and `details`.
2. **Regular Audits**:
   - Conduct quarterly audits to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
   - Use third-party auditors for an unbiased assessment.
3. **Automated Monitoring**:
   - Implement automated tools to monitor compliance and flag potential violations.
   - Use alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activities.

---

### 11.6 Compliance Validation
1. **During Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance review at each development milestone.
   - Use automated tools to scan the codebase for security vulnerabilities.
   - Perform penetration testing to identify and fix security gaps.
2. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Conduct a final compliance audit before the system goes live.
   - Schedule regular compliance reviews (e.g., annually or semi-annually).
   - Use monitoring tools to ensure ongoing compliance.

---

### 11.7 Documentation Updates
The following sections of the BRD will be updated to reflect compliance requirements:
1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Add requirements for user consent, data access, and data deletion workflows.
2. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Add requirements for data encryption, access control, and audit logging.
3. **Database Schema**:
   - Update the `Users` table to include fields for consent tracking.
   - Update the `Logs` table to include fields for compliance-related actions.
