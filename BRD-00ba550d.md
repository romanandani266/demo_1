## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
The key goals of the Retail Inventory Management System are:
- To provide a simple and efficient solution for managing retail inventory.
- To reduce stock shortages and overstocking.
- To improve supply chain efficiency.
- To enhance sales forecasting accuracy.

#### Problem Statement
Retail businesses often face challenges in managing inventory effectively, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. These issues can result in lost sales, increased costs, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, making it difficult to respond to changing market demands promptly.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Develop automated stock alert notifications.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.
- Achieve a reduction in inventory-related costs by 20% within the first year of implementation.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of the web-based application on AWS Cloud.
- Achieving a user satisfaction rate of 90% or higher among retail partners and warehouse managers.
- Reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by at least 15% within six months of implementation.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1: Inventory Tracking**
  - As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels so that I can manage inventory efficiently.
- **Use Case 2: Restocking Alerts**
  - As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low so that I can reorder products in time.
- **Use Case 3: Sales Trend Analysis**
  - As a member of the PepsiCo supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Security:** Implement role-based access control and ensure all data is encrypted.
- **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth.
