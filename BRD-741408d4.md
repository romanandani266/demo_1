## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following functionalities:
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting or mobile application development.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for tracking product stock levels.
- Predict restocking needs to minimize waste.
- Enhance supply chain efficiency for retail partners and the PepsiCo supply chain team.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and warehouse managers face challenges in managing inventory levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies in the supply chain and impacts sales forecasting accuracy.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Achieve a reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by 20% within the first year.
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15% through better inventory management.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application with real-time tracking capabilities.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers on system usability.
- Achieving the targeted reduction in stock shortages and overstocking.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis
- Web-based application development using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting
- Mobile application development

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will rely on internet connectivity for real-time tracking.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- Deployment will be on AWS Cloud hosting.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time inventory levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low to prevent shortages.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the PepsiCo supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to optimize inventory levels.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive with easy navigation.
- **Scalability**: The system should be scalable to accommodate future growth.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection.

#### Technical Requirements
