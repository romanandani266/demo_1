## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following functionalities:
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis

Limitations:
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting and mobile application development are out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
The key goals of the system are:
- To track product stock levels efficiently
- To predict restocking needs accurately
- To minimize waste in the supply chain

#### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges with stock shortages and overstocking, leading to inefficiencies in the supply chain and poor sales forecasting. The existing systems do not provide real-time data or automated alerts, resulting in delayed responses to inventory needs.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Develop a web-based inventory tracking system
- Implement automated stock alert notifications
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15%
- Enhance sales forecasting accuracy by 10%

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application
- Real-time inventory tracking with 95% accuracy
- Automated restocking alerts with a response time of less than 5 minutes
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis
- Web-based application development using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting
- Mobile application development

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will rely on internet connectivity for real-time tracking.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- The system will use PostgreSQL for database management.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time inventory levels so that I can make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low to prevent stockouts.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the PepsiCo supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to optimize inventory levels.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 2 seconds.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional retail partners.
- **Availability**: The system should have 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection and privacy.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for data exchange
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database and be accessible to authorized users.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) will be provided to illustrate data movement.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Minimalistic dashboard design
- **User Journey Mapping**: Easy navigation paths for different user roles
- **User Interface Specifications**: Consistent design elements and responsive layout
