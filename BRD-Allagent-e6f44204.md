# Project Requirements

To ensure that the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, we need to analyze the business requirements and determine which compliance standards are applicable. Below is the updated BRD with compliance considerations integrated into the existing database schema design for the Retail Inventory Management System.

# **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**

## **Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

### **Applicable Standards**
Based on the nature of the Retail Inventory Management System, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable if the system processes personal data of users in the European Union (EU).
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system handles payment card information.
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Applicable if the system processes any health-related data (not applicable in this case unless explicitly stated).
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system processes personal data of California residents.

### **Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

#### **1. GDPR Compliance**
- **Scope**: Protects personal data of EU residents.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for the system's functionality.
  - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and API tokens.
  - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access and delete their personal data.
  - **Data Breach Notification**: Notify users and authorities in case of a data breach.
  - **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of data access and modifications.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Data Minimization**: Ensure only necessary fields (e.g., `username`, `email`, `role`) are collected in the `Users` table.
  - **Encryption**: Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for `password_hash` and encrypt `token` in the `API Tokens` table.
  - **Access and Erasure**: Implement APIs to allow users to view and delete their data.
  - **Breach Notification**: Set up automated alerts for unauthorized access attempts.
  - **Audit Logs**: Add an `audit_logs` table to track user actions.

#### **2. PCI-DSS Compliance**
- **Scope**: Protects payment card information (if applicable).
- **Key Requirements**:
  - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt payment card data during storage and transmission.
  - **Access Control**: Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
  - **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans.
  - **Secure Authentication**: Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

- **Implementation**:
  - **Encryption**: If payment data is stored, use AES-256 encryption.
  - **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in the `Users` table.
  - **Audits**: Schedule regular database and application security audits.
  - **Authentication**: Enforce strong password policies and integrate MFA.

#### **3. CCPA Compliance**
- **Scope**: Protects personal data of California residents.
- **Key Requirements**:
  - **Data Transparency**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
  - **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Allow users to opt out of data collection and sharing.
  - **Data Deletion**: Provide users with the ability to delete their data.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Transparency**: Add a privacy policy page to the system.
  - **Opt-Out**: Implement an opt-out mechanism in the user settings.
  - **Data Deletion**: Extend the GDPR-compliant data deletion API to meet CCPA requirements.

### **Security Measures**

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields such as `password_hash` and `token` using industry-standard algorithms.
   - Use HTTPS for all data transmissions.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement RBAC using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
   - Restrict access to sensitive tables (e.g., `API Tokens`) to authorized roles.

3. **Audit Controls**:
   - Add an `audit_logs` table to track user actions, including login attempts, data modifications, and API calls.
   - Example schema for `audit_logs` table:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
         log_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES Users(user_id),
         action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         details TEXT
     );
     ```

4. **Authentication**:
   - Enforce strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
   - Implement MFA for all users.

5. **Data Retention Policy**:
   - Define a data retention policy to delete inactive user accounts and old audit logs after a specified period.

---

### **Validation of Compliance**

#### **During Implementation**
- Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to identify and mitigate risks.
- Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- Validate encryption and hashing mechanisms through code reviews.

#### **Post-Implementation**
- Schedule regular compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.
- Monitor system logs for unauthorized access attempts.
- Update the system to reflect changes in regulatory requirements.

---

### **Updated Database Schema**

#### **1. Users Table**
- Add a `data_erasure_requested` field to track GDPR/CCPA data deletion requests.
- Example:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Users ADD COLUMN data_erasure_requested BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
  ```

#### **2. API Tokens Table**
- Encrypt the `token` field using AES-256 encryption.

#### **3. Audit Logs Table**
- Add a new table to track user actions for compliance purposes.

#### **4. Privacy Policy Table**
- Add a table to store user consent for data collection.
- Example schema:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE privacy_policy_consents (
      consent_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES Users(user_id),
      consent_given BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
      consent_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```

---

### **Triggers and Constraints**

#### **1. Data Deletion Trigger**
- Automatically anonymize user data when a data erasure request is approved.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION anonymize_user_data()
  RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
  BEGIN
      UPDATE Users
      SET username = 'anonymous', email = NULL, password_hash = NULL
      WHERE user_id = OLD.user_id;
      RETURN OLD;
  END;
  $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  CREATE TRIGGER trigger_anonymize_user_data
  AFTER UPDATE ON Users
  FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (NEW.data_erasure_requested = TRUE)
  EXECUTE FUNCTION anonymize_user_data();
  ```
