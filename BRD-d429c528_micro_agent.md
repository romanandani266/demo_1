## Data Flow Improvements

### Data Flow Clarity
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: Ensure the DFD clearly illustrates the flow of data between frontend and backend systems, including data sources, data processing, and data storage.
- **Data Handling**: Implement data validation at both frontend and backend to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Data Storage**: Use PostgreSQL for structured data storage and ensure data is encrypted at rest.
- **Data Movement**: Optimize data movement between systems using efficient API calls and minimize data redundancy.

### Security Enhancements
- **Data Encryption**: Use TLS for data in transit and AES for data at rest.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control and ensure least privilege principle is followed.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain audit logs for all data access and modifications for compliance and security monitoring.

By implementing these recommendations, the Retail Inventory Management System will be better equipped to meet legal, regulatory, and organizational standards, ensuring a secure, accessible, and compliant solution.
