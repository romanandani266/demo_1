# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the system's requirements and to facilitate communication and collaboration among all parties involved.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, version control, and collaboration tools. The system will be limited to supporting the preferred platform, which is specified as "asa," and will not include any out-of-scope items that are not explicitly mentioned in this document.

### Business Objectives
- To streamline the software development process and improve efficiency.
- To provide a centralized platform for project management and collaboration.
- To enhance communication and coordination among team members.
- To ensure timely delivery of software projects.

### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges in managing software development projects due to a lack of centralized tools and processes. This results in inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive solution for managing the software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a user-friendly platform for project management and collaboration.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20% within the first year of implementation.
- Increase team productivity by providing tools for efficient task tracking and communication.
- Ensure data security and compliance with industry standards.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of the system on the preferred platform.
- Positive feedback from users regarding the system's usability and functionality.
- Achievement of the defined goals and objectives within the specified timeline.
- Compliance with security and data management requirements.

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and data encryption.
- **Usability**: The system should have an intuitive user interface with minimal learning curve.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime for the system.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant industry standards and regulations.

### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: To be determined based on the preferred programming language and platform.
- **Architecture**: The system will follow a microservices architecture for flexibility and scalability.
- **API Requirements**: Provide RESTful APIs for integration with third-party tools.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integrate with tools such as version control systems and communication platforms.

### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow through various modules of the system, as depicted in the Data Flow Diagram (DFD).
- **Data Storage**: Data will be stored in a relational database as per the database requirements.
- **Data Management**: Implement data backup and recovery procedures to ensure data integrity.

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Develop wireframes for key user interfaces to guide the design process.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map user journeys to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Define UI elements, color schemes, and branding guidelines.

## 3. Project Execution & Management

### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering and Analysis (4 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Design and Prototyping (6 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Development (12 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Testing and Quality Assurance (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Deployment and Training (2 weeks)

### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $500,000
- **Personnel**: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Developers, QA Engineers, UI/UX Designers

### Risk & Issue Management
- **Risk 1**: Delays in requirements gathering due to stakeholder availability.
  - **Mitigation**: Schedule regular meetings and follow up with stakeholders.
- **Risk 2**: Technical challenges in integrating with third-party tools.
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct a feasibility study and allocate additional resources if needed.

### Change Management
- **Process**: Any changes to the project scope must be documented and approved by the project manager and stakeholders. A change request form will be used to track and manage changes.

## 4. Testing & Acceptance

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system meets all functional and non-functional requirements as specified in this document.
- Successful completion of user acceptance testing (UAT) with no critical issues.

### Testing Criteria
