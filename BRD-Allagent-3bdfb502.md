- Real-time synchronization with external systems to ensure data consistency.

#### **Performance Requirements**
- The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- Real-time updates should reflect within 2 seconds of a change in inventory levels.
- The system should support a database size of up to 1TB with efficient query performance.

#### **Scalability Requirements**
- The system should be horizontally scalable to accommodate future growth in user base and data volume.
- Use of AWS Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.

#### **Monitoring and Logging**
- Implementation of monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch to track system performance and uptime.
- Centralized logging using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for debugging and auditing purposes.

#### **Backup and Recovery**

### 9. **Data Flow Validation**

#### **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**
1. **Level 0 DFD (Context Diagram)**:
   - **Data Sources**: User inputs, external supply chain systems, and sales data.
   - **Transformations**: Data validation, processing, and storage.
   - **Destinations**: Inventory database, alert notifications, and sales trend reports.

2. **Level 1 DFD (Detailed Data Flow)**:
   - **Inventory Management**:
     - Input: Stock updates from users or external systems.
     - Transformation: Validation of stock levels against thresholds.
     - Output: Updated inventory records and alerts for low stock.
   - **Sales Trend Analysis**:
     - Input: Historical sales data.
     - Transformation: Aggregation and trend analysis.
     - Output: Predicted restocking needs.
   - **User Management**:
     - Input: User credentials and role assignments.
     - Transformation: Authentication and authorization.
     - Output: Access to system features based on roles.
