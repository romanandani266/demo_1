# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is created to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication, set expectations, and provide a basis for project planning and execution.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, including planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It will provide tools and functionalities to manage each phase effectively. The system is limited to the software development process and does not include hardware management or non-software-related project management.

### Business Objectives
- Streamline the software development process to improve efficiency and reduce time-to-market.
- Enhance collaboration among development teams and stakeholders.
- Provide real-time insights and analytics to support decision-making.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices.

### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges in managing the software development life cycle, including inefficient processes, lack of collaboration, and limited visibility into project progress. These issues result in delays, increased costs, and reduced quality of software products.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized platform for managing the software development life cycle.
- Reduce development time by 20% within the first year of implementation.
- Increase team collaboration and communication by providing integrated tools.
- Achieve a 95% satisfaction rate among users of the system.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of the system within the defined timeline and budget.
- Achievement of the defined goals and objectives.
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Compliance with security and industry standards.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using the preferred platform: asa.
- The database requirements will be based on as.
- The project will adhere to known constraints and security requirements.

### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a project manager, I want to create and manage project plans to ensure timely delivery.
- **User Story 1**: As a developer, I want to access code repositories and version control to manage code changes efficiently.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should support up to 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and data encryption.
- **Usability**: The system should have an intuitive user interface with minimal learning curve.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% system uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards and regulations.

### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: To be determined based on preferred platform and programming language.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party tools.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with popular development tools and platforms.

### Data Management
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**: [Include DFDs here]
- **Data Storage**: Use a relational database as per database requirements.
- **Data Management**: Implement data backup and recovery procedures.

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: [Include wireframes here]
- **User Journey Mapping**: [Include user journey maps here]
- **User Interface Specifications**: Design a user-friendly interface with consistent branding.

## 3. Project Execution & Management

### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering and Analysis (4 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Design and Prototyping (6 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Development (12 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Testing (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Deployment and Go-Live (2 weeks)

### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $500,000
- **Required Personnel**: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Developers, QA Engineers, UI/UX Designers

### Risk & Issue Management
- **Risk 1**: Delays in development due to resource constraints. **Mitigation**: Allocate additional resources and adjust timelines.
- **Risk 2**: Security vulnerabilities. **Mitigation**: Conduct regular security audits and implement best practices.

### Change Management
- Define a formal process for handling scope changes, including impact analysis and approval procedures.

## 4. Testing & Acceptance

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
- Successful completion of user acceptance testing (UAT).
- Approval from key stakeholders.

### Testing Criteria
- **Functional Testing**: Verify all functionalities work as intended.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system performs under expected load.
- **Security Testing**: Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
- **Usability Testing**: Evaluate the user interface for ease of use.
