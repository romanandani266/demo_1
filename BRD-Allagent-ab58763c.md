- Deployment will follow a CI/CD pipeline to enable continuous integration and delivery.

---

### 13. **User Interface Requirements**
- The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring ease of use for all target audiences.
- The UI will include dashboards for real-time inventory tracking, alerts, and sales trend analysis.
- Responsive design will ensure compatibility across desktop and tablet devices.
- Accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1) will be followed to ensure usability for all users.

---

### 14. **Competitors/References**
- Competitor analysis and references will be considered during the design and development phases to ensure the system meets or exceeds industry standards.

---

### 15. **Technical Requirements**

#### **System Capabilities**
1. **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**:
   - Use WebSocket or similar real-time communication protocols to update inventory data dynamically.
   - Implement APIs to fetch and update inventory data in real-time.

2. **Automated Restocking Alerts**:
   - Use a rule-based engine to trigger alerts when stock levels fall below predefined thresholds.
   - Integrate with email and SMS gateways for sending notifications.

3. **Sales Trend Analysis**:
   - Use data analytics libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy) or tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for analyzing sales trends.
   - Implement basic machine learning models for trend prediction (e.g., linear regression).

#### **Technologies and Tools**
- **Frontend**: React.js or Angular for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python (Django/Flask) for developing the server-side logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing inventory and sales data.
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket or SignalR for real-time updates.
- **Hosting**: AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS) or Azure (App Services, SQL Database).
- **Version Control**: GitHub or GitLab for source code management.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI for continuous integration and deployment.

#### **Integration Requirements**
- APIs for integrating with existing ERP systems or supply chain management tools.
- Data import/export functionality to allow integration with external systems.
