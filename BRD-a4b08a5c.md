## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for developing a Retail Inventory Management System. This document will serve as a guide for project stakeholders, developers, and business managers throughout the software development life cycle, ensuring that the system meets the business objectives and user needs.

### Scope of the Project
The project aims to develop a web-based application for retail inventory management. The system will include functionalities such as real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis. Integrations with third-party services, such as PepsiCo’s supply chain system, will be included. Advanced AI-driven forecasting and mobile application development are out of scope for this project.

### Business Objectives
- Improve inventory visibility and accuracy.
- Enhance decision-making with real-time data.
- Enable seamless user authentication and role-based access control.

### Problem Statement
The current inventory management processes face challenges such as inefficiencies in tracking inventory, difficulties in managing sales trends, and security vulnerabilities in user authentication.

### Goals & Objectives
- Reduce stockouts by 20%.
- Provide real-time analytics for better decision-making.
- Improve inventory accuracy by 30%.

### Key Success Criteria
- Response time for user interactions should be under 2 seconds.
- Inventory tracking accuracy should be above 95%.
- User adoption rates should exceed 80% within the first six months.

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Data Flow Clarity:**
   - Clearly define data flow diagrams to visualize how data moves through the system, from user input to database storage and back to the user interface.
   - Ensure that data flow is documented for each integration point, especially with third-party services like PepsiCo’s supply chain system.

2. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement additional security measures such as rate limiting and IP whitelisting for API endpoints.
   - Regularly update and patch dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.

3. **Efficiency Improvements:**
   - Optimize database queries and use indexing to improve data retrieval times.
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce load times.

4. **Scalability Considerations:**
   - Plan for future scalability by designing the system to support microservices architecture, allowing for independent scaling of different components.

5. **Compliance and Data Privacy:**
   - Regularly audit data handling processes to ensure ongoing compliance with GDPR and CCPA.
   - Implement data anonymization techniques where applicable to enhance user privacy.

6. **User Journey Consistency:**
   - Ensure the flow is logical, with clear navigation and intuitive transitions that align with user goals.

7. **Design Consistency:**
   - Confirm UI elements (buttons, icons, text) are consistent and follow the design system.

8. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Check that interactive elements are functional, with proper feedback on actions.

9. **Accessibility:**
   - Validate that the design meets accessibility standards (color contrast, font size, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).

10. **Error Handling:**
    - Ensure error messages are clear, helpful, and guide users toward corrections.

11. **Mobile Responsiveness:**
    - Verify the flow adapts well across devices and screen sizes, with intuitive touch interactions.

12. **User Feedback:**
    - Ensure easy access to feedback mechanisms like surveys or ratings.

13. **Performance:**
    - Confirm smooth transitions, animations, and minimal load times.

By incorporating these recommendations, the Retail Inventory Management System will be better positioned to meet business goals while ensuring secure, efficient, and scalable data handling.
