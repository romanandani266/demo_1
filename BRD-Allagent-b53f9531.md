   - Provide mechanisms for users to exercise their rights under GDPR and CCPA:
     - **Right to Know**: Users can request information about their stored data.
     - **Right to Delete**: Users can request the deletion of their data.
     - **Right to Opt-Out**: Users can opt out of data sharing.

4. **Data Retention**
   - Define and enforce data retention policies to ensure data is not stored longer than necessary.

5. **Auditability**
   - Maintain audit logs to track system access and data changes.
   - Conduct regular access monitoring and periodic reviews.

6. **Data Flow Validation**
   - Ensure proper handling and routing of data between systems and components.
   - Validate data sources, transformations, and destinations to ensure compliance with business goals, data privacy standards, and performance requirements.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Performance**
   - The system should support up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency (<2 seconds for critical operations).
   - Ensure real-time inventory updates with a delay of no more than 1 second.

2. **Scalability**
   - The system should scale horizontally to accommodate increased user load and data volume.
   - Support integration with third-party systems (e.g., ERP, CRM) via APIs.

3. **Security**
   - Ensure compliance with GDPR and CCPA by implementing encryption, access control, and data masking.
   - Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

4. **Integration**
   - Provide APIs for integration with existing retail systems.
   - Ensure compatibility with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) for hosting and scalability.

## **6. Implementation in the System**
### **Security Measures**
1. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
2. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control.
3. **Data Masking**: Mask sensitive data where applicable.
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
5. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan.

### **Data Handling**
1. **Data Collection**: Collect only the minimum required data (username, password_hash, role).
2. **Data Storage**: Store data securely using encryption.
3. **Data Sharing**: Restrict data sharing to authorized entities only.
4. **Data Retention**: Define and enforce data retention policies.

### **Auditability**
1. **Audit Logs**: Maintain detailed logs of system access and data changes.
2. **Access Monitoring**: Monitor access to sensitive data.
3. **Periodic Reviews**: Conduct periodic reviews of system security and compliance.

## **7. Technical Requirements**
### **System Capabilities**
1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Use OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for secure user authentication.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.

2. **Data Storage**
   - Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) for structured data storage.
   - Implement encryption at rest using AES-256.

3. **Data Transmission**
