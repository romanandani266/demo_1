# Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time inventory tracking
- Automated restocking alerts
- Sales trend analysis

The system will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting or mobile application development. The focus will be on creating a web-based application that is simple and efficient for retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers.

### Business Objectives
The key goals of the Retail Inventory Management System are:
- To track product stock levels accurately
- To predict restocking needs effectively
- To minimize waste and reduce stock shortages and overstocking
- To improve supply chain efficiency
- To enhance sales forecasting capabilities

### Problem Statement
The current inventory management processes face challenges such as inaccurate stock levels, inefficient restocking procedures, and poor sales forecasting. These issues lead to stock shortages, overstocking, and increased waste, ultimately affecting the supply chain efficiency and sales performance.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a real-time inventory tracking system
- Develop automated alerts for restocking needs
- Analyze sales trends to improve forecasting
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking within the first year
- Enhance supply chain efficiency by 15% through improved inventory management

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based inventory tracking system
- Reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by at least 20%
- Improved sales forecasting accuracy by 25%
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers
