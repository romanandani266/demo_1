# Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The system will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

### Business Objectives
The key goals of the Retail Inventory Management System are:
- To reduce stock shortages and overstocking.
- To improve supply chain efficiency.
- To enhance sales forecasting accuracy.

### Problem Statement
Retail partners and the PepsiCo supply chain team face challenges in managing inventory levels effectively, leading to stock shortages, overstocking, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. The current system lacks real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, resulting in missed sales opportunities and increased waste.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application on AWS Cloud.
- Achieving a reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by at least 20%.
- Improved supply chain efficiency as measured by reduced lead times and waste.

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis.

### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- Role-based access control and encrypted data storage will be implemented for security.
- The project is constrained by budget limitations for advanced analytics.
- Internet dependency is required for real-time tracking.

### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
#### Use Case 1: Real-Time Inventory Tracking
- **User Story**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view current stock levels in real-time so that I can make informed decisions about restocking.

#### Use Case 2: Automated Restocking Alerts
- **User Story**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels fall below a certain threshold so that I can reorder products in a timely manner.

#### Use Case 3: Sales Trend Analysis
- **User Story**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs and optimize stock levels.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection and privacy.

### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database and be accessible via the web application.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**: [Include DFDs here]

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: [Include wireframes here]
- **User Journey Mapping**: [Include user journey maps here]
- **User Interface Specifications**: Minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation.

## 3. Project Execution & Management

### Timeline & Milestones

- **Phase 2**: Design & Architecture (4 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Development (8 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Testing (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Deployment (2 weeks)

### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $150,000
- **Personnel**: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Developers, QA Engineers, UI/UX Designers.

### Risk & Issue Management
- **Potential Risks**: Delays in development, budget overruns, security vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Regular progress reviews, contingency budget, security audits.

### Change Management
- **Process**: All scope changes must be approved by the project steering committee and documented in the change log.

## 4. Testing & Acceptance

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system must meet all functional and non-functional requirements.
- Successful user acceptance testing (UAT) with no critical issues.

### Testing Criteria
