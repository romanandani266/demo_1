# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System (RIMS)

## Overview
The Retail Inventory Management System (RIMS) is designed to streamline inventory management, user authentication, restocking alerts, sales trend analysis, and data export functionalities. The system ensures role-based access control, real-time updates, and high performance to meet business needs. Additionally, the system will comply with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards to ensure data security, privacy, and auditability.

## Compliance and Regulatory Standards

### **Applicable Standards**
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the data being processed, the following compliance standards are applicable to RIMS:
1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the collection and processing of user data (e.g., names, emails, and roles).
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system handles payment-related data (e.g., price and sales data).
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Not applicable unless the system processes health-related data.
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system is used by businesses operating in California and meets the CCPA thresholds.

### **Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

#### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Data Minimization: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
  - Consent Management: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
  - Right to Access and Erasure: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
  - Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
  - Data Breach Notification: Notify users and authorities within 72 hours of a data breach.
  - Data Retention Policy: Define and enforce a policy for data retention and deletion.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Data Minimization**: Ensure the database schema only includes necessary fields (e.g., no unnecessary personal data).
  - **Consent Management**: Add a consent field in the `Users` table to track user consent.
  - **Access and Erasure**: Implement APIs to allow users to view and delete their data.
  - **Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data like passwords and TLS for data in transit.
  - **Breach Notification**: Set up automated alerts for potential breaches and a notification system.
  - **Retention Policy**: Define a policy to delete inactive user accounts and old sales data after a specified period.

#### **2. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Secure Storage: Do not store sensitive payment data unless absolutely necessary.
  - Access Control: Restrict access to payment-related data to authorized personnel only.
  - Regular Audits: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans.
  - Logging and Monitoring: Maintain logs of all access to payment-related data.
  - Data Encryption: Encrypt payment-related data both in transit and at rest.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Secure Storage**: Avoid storing sensitive payment data in the system. If required, tokenize payment data.
  - **Access Control**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to payment-related data.
  - **Audits**: Schedule regular security audits and penetration testing.
  - **Logging**: Implement logging for all access to the `Sales` table and other payment-related data.
  - **Encryption**: Use strong encryption algorithms for payment-related data.

#### **3. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Data Transparency: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
  - Opt-Out Mechanism: Allow users to opt out of data collection and sale.
  - Data Access: Provide users with access to their data upon request.
  - Data Deletion: Allow users to request the deletion of their data.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Transparency**: Update the privacy policy to include details about data collection and usage.
  - **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Add an opt-out feature in the user settings.
  - **Data Access**: Implement APIs to allow users to view their data.
  - **Data Deletion**: Extend the GDPR-compliant data deletion feature to meet CCPA requirements.

### **Security Measures**
1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Use AES-256 for encrypting sensitive data at rest.
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher for encrypting data in transit.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin and manager roles.

3. **Audit Controls**:
   - Maintain logs of all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
   - Store logs in a secure, tamper-proof system.

4. **Data Masking**:
   - Mask sensitive data (e.g., email addresses) in non-production environments.

5. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct quarterly security audits and vulnerability assessments.

---

### **Data Privacy Rules**
1. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
   - Store consent records in the `Users` table.

2. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize data used for analytics to protect user privacy.

3. **Data Retention**:
   - Define a retention policy for each data type (e.g., delete sales data older than 5 years).

4. **Right to Erasure**:
   - Implement a feature to allow users to delete their accounts and associated data.

---

### **Audit Controls**
1. **Activity Logging**:
   - Log all user activities, including logins, data access, and modifications.
   - Store logs in a secure, centralized logging system.

2. **Access Reviews**:
   - Conduct periodic reviews of user access rights to ensure compliance with RBAC policies.

3. **Data Integrity Checks**:
   - Implement automated checks to detect and report data inconsistencies.

4. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Schedule annual compliance audits to ensure adherence to GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.

---

### **Validation of Compliance**
1. **During Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance review at each development milestone.
   - Perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments before deployment.

2. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Schedule regular compliance audits (e.g., quarterly for PCI-DSS, annually for GDPR).
   - Monitor system logs for suspicious activities and potential breaches.
   - Update the system to address new regulatory requirements as they arise.
