# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the system's requirements and to facilitate communication among all parties involved.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting. The system will be limited to the functionalities outlined in this document and will not include any features outside the defined scope.

### Business Objectives
- To streamline the software development process.
- To improve collaboration and communication among team members.
- To enhance project visibility and reporting.
- To ensure timely delivery of software projects.

### Problem Statement
The current software development process is fragmented and lacks a centralized system for managing projects. This leads to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing a unified platform for managing the software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized system for managing software development projects.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20%.
- Increase team collaboration and communication by 30%.
- Improve project visibility and reporting accuracy by 40%.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of the system within the defined timeline and budget.
- Achieving the targeted reduction in project delivery time.
- Positive feedback from users regarding improved collaboration and communication.
- Accurate and timely project reporting.
