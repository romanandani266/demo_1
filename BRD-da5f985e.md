# Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Project Name: Retail Inventory Management System

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
This Business Requirements Document (BRD) is created to outline the requirements for developing a Retail Inventory Management System. It serves as a guide for project stakeholders, developers, and business managers throughout the software development life cycle, ensuring that the project aligns with business objectives and technical specifications.

#### Scope of the Project
The project aims to develop a web-based application for efficient retail inventory management. The system will include functionalities such as real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis. Integrations with third-party services, such as PepsiCo’s supply chain system, are included. Advanced AI-driven forecasting and mobile application development are out of scope for this project.

#### Business Objectives
- Improve inventory visibility and management.
- Enhance decision-making with real-time data.
- Enable seamless user authentication and role-based access control.

#### Problem Statement
The current inventory management processes face challenges such as inefficiencies in tracking inventory, difficulties in managing sales trends, and security vulnerabilities in user authentication.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Reduce stockouts by 20%.
- Provide real-time analytics for better decision-making.
- Improve inventory accuracy and reduce waste.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Response time for user interactions should be under 2 seconds.
- Achieve 95% accuracy in inventory tracking.
- User adoption rate of 80% within the first three months.
