### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the ability to track stock levels in real-time.
- Minimize waste by predicting restocking needs accurately.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and supply chain teams face challenges in managing inventory efficiently, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in increased costs and reduced sales opportunities. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, which hampers decision-making.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated notifications for stock alerts.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application.
- Achieving a reduction in stock shortages and overstocking.
- Improved supply chain efficiency and sales forecasting accuracy.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- The system will rely on internet connectivity for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels so that I can make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low to prevent shortages.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional retail partners.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database and be accessible via the web application.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Data will be managed through a centralized dashboard.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Include wireframes for the dashboard and key interfaces.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map out the user journey from login to inventory management.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Design a minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation.
