## Technical Requirements
### System Capabilities
1. **Real-Time Inventory Tracking:**
   - Use WebSocket or REST APIs for real-time data synchronization.
   - Implement a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times.

2. **Predictive Analytics:**
   - Leverage machine learning models to forecast restocking needs based on historical data.
   - Use a data pipeline (e.g., Apache Kafka) to process and analyze inventory data in real-time.

3. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and authorization.
   - Define user roles and permissions in the database schema.

4. **Reporting and Analytics Dashboard:**
   - Use a visualization library (e.g., D3.js or Chart.js) for interactive charts and graphs.
   - Provide export options for reports in formats like PDF and Excel.

5. **Notifications:**
   - Integrate with email and SMS gateways (e.g., Twilio) for sending alerts.
   - Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) to handle notification delivery.

### Security Considerations
- Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256 encryption.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication between the client and server.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users.

### Performance and Scalability
- Use a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
- Optimize database queries and use indexing to improve performance.
- Implement horizontal scaling to handle increased user load.

### Integration
- Use APIs to integrate with existing retail and supply chain systems.
- Ensure compatibility with standard data formats like JSON and XML.
- Provide a middleware layer for data transformation and validation.
