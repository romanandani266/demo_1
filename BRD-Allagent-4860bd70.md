# Project Requirements

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis and updates will be incorporated into the Business Requirements Document (BRD). This will include identifying applicable compliance standards, outlining their requirements, and specifying how the system will meet them. Additionally, security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls will be documented, along with instructions for validating compliance during and after implementation.

## **Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
#### **Applicability**:
GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU).

#### **Compliance Requirements**:
1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the system's purpose.
2. **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent for processing personal data.
3. **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
4. **Data Breach Notification**: Notify authorities and affected individuals within 72 hours of a data breach.
5. **Data Protection by Design and Default**: Implement technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection.
6. **Data Transfer**: Ensure data transfers outside the EU comply with GDPR (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).

#### **Implementation in the System**:
- **Data Minimization**: Limit user data collection to `username`, `password_hash`, and `role`.
- **Consent Management**: Add a consent mechanism during user registration.
- **Access and Erasure**: Provide API endpoints for users to view and delete their data.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Implement a monitoring system to detect breaches and notify stakeholders.
- **Data Protection by Design**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`) and use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
- **Data Transfer**: Use GDPR-compliant cloud providers for data storage.

### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**
#### **Applicability**:
HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). If the system does not handle PHI, this standard may not apply.

#### **Compliance Requirements**:
1. **Access Controls**: Restrict access to PHI based on user roles.
2. **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
3. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensure data is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
5. **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with HIPAA.

#### **Implementation in the System**:
- **Access Controls**: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
- **Audit Controls**: Log all actions in the `Audit Logs` table.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data fields and use HTTPS for API communication.
- **Data Integrity**: Implement checksums and validation mechanisms for data integrity.
- **BAAs**: Ensure cloud providers and third-party services sign BAAs.

### **3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**
#### **Applicability**:
PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information. If the system does not handle payments, this standard may not apply.

#### **Compliance Requirements**:
1. **Secure Network**: Use firewalls and secure configurations.
2. **Data Protection**: Encrypt cardholder data and restrict access.
3. **Access Control**: Implement role-based access and unique user IDs.
4. **Monitoring and Testing**: Regularly test security systems and processes.
5. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for responding to security incidents.

#### **Implementation in the System**:
- **Secure Network**: Use firewalls and secure cloud configurations.
- **Data Protection**: Avoid storing payment card data directly; use tokenization or third-party payment processors.
- **Access Control**: Implement RBAC and unique user IDs.
- **Monitoring and Testing**: Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
- **Incident Response**: Develop an incident response plan.

## **Security Measures**

1. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data fields (e.g., `password_hash`) using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement RBAC to restrict access based on user roles (`Admin`, `Manager`, `Viewer`).
   - Enforce strong password policies.

3. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize data in reports and logs where possible.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Use monitoring tools to detect unauthorized access and unusual activity.
   - Set up alerts for critical events (e.g., failed login attempts, data breaches).

5. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Implement regular backups and test recovery procedures.

---

## **Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Retention**:
   - Retain user data only as long as necessary for business purposes.
   - Automatically delete inactive user accounts after a specified period.

2. **User Rights**:
   - Provide mechanisms for users to access, update, and delete their data.

3. **Third-Party Data Sharing**:
   - Share data with third parties only under strict agreements and for legitimate purposes.

---

## **Audit Controls**

1. **Audit Logs**:
   - Log all actions performed by users, including login attempts, data modifications, and report generation.
   - Store logs in the `Audit Logs` table.

2. **Log Retention**:
   - Retain logs for a minimum of 1 year or as required by applicable regulations.

3. **Log Review**:
   - Regularly review logs for suspicious activity.

---

## **Compliance Validation**

1. **During Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance review at each development milestone.
   - Perform security testing, including vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

2. **After Implementation**:
   - Conduct regular compliance audits.
   - Use automated tools to monitor compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain detailed documentation of compliance measures and audit results.
