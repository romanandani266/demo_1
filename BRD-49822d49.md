## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The system will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient inventory management system.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking.
- Minimize waste through better inventory management.
- Improve supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and warehouse managers face challenges in maintaining optimal stock levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies in the supply chain and potential loss of sales. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, making it difficult to respond promptly to inventory needs.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based system for real-time inventory tracking.
- Provide automated notifications for restocking.
- Enable sales trend analysis to improve forecasting accuracy.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based inventory management system.
- Reduction in stock shortages and overstocking incidents.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers on system usability and efficiency.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking functionality.
- Automated restocking alert system.
- Sales trend analysis tools.
- Web-based application accessible via browsers.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting features.
- Development of a mobile application.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- Budget constraints may limit the implementation of advanced analytics.
- The system will rely on internet connectivity for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels so that I can make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low to prevent stockouts.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate additional users and data.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database, where it will be processed and analyzed.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Data will be managed through a centralized dashboard.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Include wireframes for the main dashboard and alert notifications.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map the user journey from login to inventory management.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Design a minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation.
