## Retail Inventory Management System

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for the design, development, and implementation of the system.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient inventory management system.
- Track product stock levels accurately.
- Predict restocking needs to minimize waste.
- Enhance supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail businesses face challenges in managing inventory effectively, leading to stock shortages, overstocking, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, resulting in lost sales opportunities and increased operational costs.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking.
- Improve sales forecasting accuracy by 15%.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application.
- Real-time inventory tracking with 95% accuracy.
- Automated alerts functioning as intended.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis.
- Web-based application using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will rely on internet connectivity for real-time tracking.
- Budget constraints limit the implementation of advanced analytics.
- Deployment will be on AWS Cloud hosting.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low to prevent shortages.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to optimize inventory levels.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional retail partners.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for data exchange.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database and be accessible via the web application.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) will be provided to illustrate data movement.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Minimalistic dashboard design.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Easy navigation paths for different user roles.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Consistent design language and responsive layout.

### 3. Project Execution & Management

#### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Design & Prototyping (4 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Development (8 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Testing (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: Deployment & Training (2 weeks)

#### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $150,000
- **Personnel**: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Developers, QA Engineers, UI/UX Designers.

#### Risk & Issue Management
- **Risk 1**: Internet dependency may affect real-time tracking.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement offline data caching.
- **Risk 2**: Budget constraints may limit feature development.
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize essential features.

#### Change Management
- **Process**: All scope changes must be approved by the project manager and documented in the change log.

### 4. Testing & Acceptance

#### Acceptance Criteria
- The system must meet all functional and non-functional requirements.
- Successful user acceptance testing by retail partners and warehouse managers.

#### Testing Criteria
- **Functional Testing**: Verify all use cases and user stories.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system handles peak loads.
- **Security Testing**: Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Usability Testing**: Gather feedback from end-users on the interface.

### 5. Supporting Documentation
