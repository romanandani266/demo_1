# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is created to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication, set expectations, and provide a basis for project planning and execution.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, including planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It will provide tools and functionalities to streamline these processes, improve collaboration, and enhance productivity. The system will be limited to the specified functionalities and will not include any out-of-scope items mentioned later in this document.

### Business Objectives
- To streamline the software development process.
- To enhance collaboration among team members.
- To improve productivity and efficiency.
- To ensure timely delivery of software projects.

### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges in managing the software development life cycle, leading to inefficiencies, communication gaps, and delays in project delivery. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing a centralized platform for managing the entire life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized platform for managing the software development life cycle.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20%.
- Improve team collaboration and communication.
- Increase productivity by automating repetitive tasks.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of the system within the defined timeline and budget.
- Achieving a 20% reduction in project delivery time.
- Positive feedback from users regarding improved collaboration and productivity.
