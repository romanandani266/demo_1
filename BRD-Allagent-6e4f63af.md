## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Project Name**
Retail Inventory Management System

### **1.2 Project Description**
The Retail Inventory Management System is a web-based solution designed to help retail partners and supply chain teams efficiently track product stock levels, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste. The system aims to address common inventory management challenges, such as stock shortages, overstocking, and inefficiencies, by leveraging modern technology and data-driven insights.

### **1.3 Background**
Retail businesses often face significant challenges in managing inventory due to fluctuating demand, supply chain disruptions, and lack of real-time visibility into stock levels. These issues can lead to financial losses, customer dissatisfaction, and operational inefficiencies. The proposed system will provide a centralized platform to streamline inventory management processes and improve decision-making.
