# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to be a reference throughout the project lifecycle to ensure alignment and successful project execution.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting. The system is limited to internal use within the organization and does not include customer-facing functionalities.

### Business Objectives
- Streamline the software development process to improve efficiency and productivity.
- Enhance collaboration and communication among team members.
- Provide real-time visibility into project progress and performance.
- Reduce time-to-market for software products.

### Problem Statement
The current software development process is fragmented and lacks a centralized system for managing projects. This leads to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery. The new system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform for managing the entire software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized system for managing software development projects.
- Improve team collaboration and communication through integrated tools.
- Provide real-time reporting and analytics to track project performance.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20% within the first year of implementation.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of the system within the defined timeline and budget.
- Positive feedback from users regarding system usability and functionality.
- Achievement of a 20% reduction in project delivery time.
- Increased team productivity and collaboration.

## 2. Project Scope & Requirements

### In-Scope Items
- Project management and task tracking features.
- Collaboration tools such as chat, file sharing, and document management.
- Real-time reporting and analytics dashboard.
- Integration with existing tools and systems.

### Out-of-Scope Items
- Customer-facing functionalities.
- Mobile application development.
- Customization for individual user preferences.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be used internally within the organization.
- The project will be completed within a 12-month timeline.
- Budget constraints may limit the scope of certain features.

### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a project manager, I want to create and assign tasks to team members so that I can track project progress.
- **User Story 1**: As a developer, I want to update the status of my tasks so that the project manager can see my progress.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should support up to 500 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control to ensure data security.
- **Usability**: The system should have an intuitive user interface that requires minimal training.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to accommodate future growth.
- **Availability**: The system should have 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: The system should comply with industry standards and regulations.

### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Preferred platform is ASA.
- **Architecture**: The system should follow a microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: Provide RESTful APIs for integration with third-party tools.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integrate with existing project management and communication tools.

### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow through a centralized database with defined access controls.
- **Data Storage**: Use a relational database to store project data.
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**: [Include DFDs here]

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: [Include wireframes here]
- **User Journey Mapping**: [Include user journey mapping here]
- **User Interface Specifications**: The interface should be clean, modern, and responsive.

## 3. Project Execution & Management

### Timeline & Milestones
- **Phase 1**: Requirements Gathering (2 months)
- **Phase 2**: Design and Prototyping (3 months)
- **Phase 3**: Development (4 months)
- **Phase 4**: Testing and Quality Assurance (2 months)
- **Phase 5**: Deployment and Training (1 month)

### Budget & Resources
- **Estimated Budget**: $500,000
- **Required Personnel**: Project Manager, Developers, QA Engineers, UX/UI Designers, Business Analysts

### Risk & Issue Management
- **Risk 1**: Delays in development due to resource constraints. **Mitigation**: Allocate additional resources as needed.
- **Risk 2**: Resistance to change from users. **Mitigation**: Provide comprehensive training and support.

### Change Management
- **Process**: Any changes to the project scope must be approved by the project steering committee and documented in a change request form.

## 4. Testing & Acceptance

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
- Successful completion of user acceptance testing (UAT).
- Positive feedback from key stakeholders.

### Testing Criteria
- **Functional Testing**: Verify that all features work as intended.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system can handle the expected load.
- **Security Testing**: Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
- **Usability Testing**: Gather user feedback on the interface and make necessary improvements.
