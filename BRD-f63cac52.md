# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to be a reference throughout the project lifecycle to ensure alignment and successful project execution.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting. The system is limited to the software development process and does not include hardware management or non-software-related project management.

### Business Objectives
- Streamline the software development process to improve efficiency and productivity.
- Enhance collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
- Provide real-time visibility into project progress and performance.
- Reduce project delivery time and improve quality.

### Problem Statement
The current software development process is fragmented and lacks a centralized system for managing projects. This leads to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery. The new system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform for managing the entire software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized system for managing software development projects.
- Improve team collaboration and communication.
- Provide tools for tracking project progress and performance.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20%.
- Increase project quality and customer satisfaction.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful implementation and adoption of the system by the development team.
- Measurable improvement in project delivery time and quality.
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Achievement of project objectives within the defined timeline and budget.
