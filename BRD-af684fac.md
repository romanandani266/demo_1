### Wireframes, Prototypes, or Mockups Validation

- **Wireframes**: Validate that wireframes reflect the user tasks and workflows, with logical layout and navigation paths.
- **Prototypes**: Test prototypes for usability, ensuring that interactions are smooth and intuitive.
- **Mockups**: Ensure mockups align with the visual design standards and enhance user experience.

### Ensuring Ease of Use, Accessibility, and Responsiveness

- **Ease of Use**: Design interfaces that are intuitive, with minimal learning curve for users.
