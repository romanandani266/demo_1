# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is created to outline the requirements and expectations for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to be a reference throughout the project lifecycle to ensure alignment and successful project execution.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting. The system will be limited to the functionalities outlined in this document and will not include advanced AI-driven analytics or third-party integrations not specified herein.

### Business Objectives
- Streamline the software development process to improve efficiency and productivity.
- Enhance collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
- Provide real-time tracking and reporting of project progress.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards and best practices.

### Problem Statement
The current software development process is fragmented and lacks a centralized system for managing projects, leading to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays. The new system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform for managing the entire software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized platform for managing software development projects.
- Reduce project completion time by 20% within the first year of implementation.
- Increase team collaboration and communication by providing integrated tools.
- Achieve a user satisfaction rate of 85% or higher within six months of deployment.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of the system within the agreed timeline and budget.
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Measurable improvements in project management efficiency and team collaboration.
