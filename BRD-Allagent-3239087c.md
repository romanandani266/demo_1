### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

## **Compliance and Regulatory Standards**

To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System (RIMS) complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system must adhere to regulations such as **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, and **PCI-DSS**, depending on the nature of the data it processes. Below is a detailed breakdown of the applicable standards, their requirements, and how the system will meet them.

---

### **1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

#### **Applicability**
GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU), such as user information (e.g., `username`, `email`, `password_hash`).

#### **Compliance Requirements**
1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.
2. **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
3. **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
5. **Data Breach Notification**: Notify authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
6. **Data Retention Policy**: Define and enforce a policy for retaining and deleting user data.

#### **Implementation in RIMS**
- **Data Minimization**: Only store essential user data (`username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role_id`).
- **Consent Management**: Add a consent mechanism during user registration.
- **Access and Erasure**: Implement APIs to allow users to view and delete their data.
- **Encryption**: Use AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2+ for data in transit.
- **Breach Notification**: Set up automated alerts for potential breaches and a process for notifying users.
- **Retention Policy**: Define a policy to delete inactive user accounts after a specified period.

### **2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**

#### **Applicability**
HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI). If RIMS is used in a healthcare context (e.g., tracking medical inventory), HIPAA compliance is required.

#### **Compliance Requirements**
1. **Access Control**: Restrict access to PHI based on user roles.
2. **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
3. **Data Integrity**: Ensure that PHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
4. **Transmission Security**: Protect PHI during electronic transmission.
5. **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)**: Ensure third-party vendors comply with HIPAA.

#### **Implementation in RIMS**
- **Access Control**: Use the `Roles` table to enforce role-based access to sensitive data.
- **Audit Controls**: Log all access and changes to inventory and sales data.
- **Data Integrity**: Implement checksums and hashing to verify data integrity.
- **Transmission Security**: Use TLS 1.2+ for all data transmissions.
- **BAAs**: Require vendors (e.g., cloud providers) to sign BAAs.

### **3. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**

#### **Applicability**
PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information. If RIMS integrates with a payment gateway for sales transactions, compliance is mandatory.

#### **Compliance Requirements**
1. **Secure Cardholder Data**: Do not store sensitive cardholder data unless absolutely necessary.
2. **Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel.
3. **Encryption**: Encrypt cardholder data during storage and transmission.
4. **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and apply patches.
5. **Monitoring and Testing**: Monitor access to cardholder data and conduct regular security testing.

#### **Implementation in RIMS**
- **Secure Cardholder Data**: Use a third-party payment gateway to handle cardholder data.
- **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized users can access payment-related data.
- **Encryption**: Use end-to-end encryption for payment data.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Schedule regular vulnerability scans and updates.
- **Monitoring and Testing**: Implement logging and monitoring for payment transactions.

### **4. Security Measures**

To comply with the above regulations, the following security measures will be incorporated into the system:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Use strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the `Roles` table.

2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`, `email`) using AES-256.
   - Use TLS 1.2+ for all data transmissions.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Log all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
   - Use a centralized logging system for real-time monitoring.

4. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Conduct periodic security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

5. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Implement automated backups with encryption.
   - Test recovery procedures regularly.

---

### **5. Data Privacy Rules**

1. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize user data for analytics and reporting purposes.

2. **Data Access**:
   - Allow users to view, update, and delete their personal data.

3. **Data Sharing**:
   - Do not share user data with third parties without explicit consent.

4. **Data Retention**:
   - Define retention periods for different types of data (e.g., sales data, user accounts).

---

### **6. Audit Controls**

1. **Access Logs**:
   - Maintain logs of all user access to sensitive data.

2. **Change Logs**:
   - Record all changes to critical tables (e.g., `Users`, `Inventory`, `Sales`).

3. **Audit Reports**:
   - Generate periodic audit reports for compliance verification.

---

### **7. Compliance Validation**

#### **During Implementation**
1. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct code reviews to ensure compliance with security and privacy standards.
2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
3. **Compliance Checklists**:
   - Use checklists to verify adherence to GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS requirements.

#### **After Implementation**
1. **Regular Audits**:
   - Schedule regular compliance audits.
2. **Monitoring**:
   - Use monitoring tools to detect and respond to compliance violations.
3. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect user feedback to identify potential compliance issues.

---

### **8. Integration with Database Schema**

The database schema outlined in the BRD will be updated to include fields and mechanisms required for compliance:

1. **Users Table**:
   - Add a `consent_status` field to track user consent.
   - Add a `data_retention_period` field to define retention policies.

2. **Audit Logs**:
   - Create a new `AuditLogs` table to store access and change logs.
   - Fields: `log_id`, `user_id`, `action`, `timestamp`, `details`.

3. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., `password_hash`, `email`) in the `Users` table.

This updated BRD ensures that the Retail Inventory Management System is not only functional and scalable but also compliant with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards.
