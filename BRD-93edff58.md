## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking.
- Minimize waste through better inventory management.
- Improve supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and supply chain teams face challenges in managing inventory levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies and increased costs. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, making it difficult to optimize inventory management.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated notifications for restocking.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.
- Achieve a reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by 20% within the first year.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all stakeholders.
- Real-time inventory tracking with a 95% accuracy rate.
- Automated restocking alerts with a response time of less than 5 minutes.
- Positive feedback from at least 80% of users within the first three months.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking system.
- Automated restocking alert notifications.
- Sales trend analysis tools.
- Web-based application interface.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- The system will rely on internet connectivity for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed decisions about restocking.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels fall below a certain threshold.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and require minimal training.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional retail partners.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture for scalability.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with third-party systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain management tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database, with real-time updates.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Data will be managed through a centralized dashboard.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Include wireframes for the main dashboard and alert notifications.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map the user journey from login to inventory management.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Minimalistic design with easy navigation.
