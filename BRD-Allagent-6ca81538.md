### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System (RIMS)

---

## **Overview**
The Retail Inventory Management System (RIMS) is designed to streamline inventory management, user authentication, sales trend analysis, and notifications for restocking alerts. The system will provide a secure and efficient way to manage inventory, analyze sales trends, and ensure optimal stock levels. Additionally, the system will comply with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards to ensure data security, privacy, and auditability.

## **Compliance Standards**

### **Applicable Regulations**
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the system, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the collection and processing of user data, including personal information such as names, emails, and roles.
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system integrates with payment processing for sales.
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Not applicable unless the system handles Protected Health Information (PHI).
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system is used by businesses operating in California and meets the threshold for CCPA applicability.

### **Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

#### **1. GDPR Compliance**
- **Requirements**:
  - Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
  - Allow users to access, modify, or delete their personal data.
  - Ensure data is stored securely and encrypted.
  - Notify users in case of a data breach within 72 hours.
  - Maintain records of data processing activities.

- **Implementation**:
  - Add a consent mechanism during user registration.
  - Provide a user interface for managing personal data (view, edit, delete).
  - Encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and session tokens.
  - Implement a breach notification system to alert users and authorities.
  - Maintain an audit log of all data processing activities.

#### **2. PCI-DSS Compliance**
- **Requirements**:
  - Encrypt payment data during transmission and storage.
  - Restrict access to payment data to authorized personnel only.
  - Regularly test and monitor security systems.
  - Maintain a secure network and firewall configuration.

- **Implementation**:
  - Use secure payment gateways for processing transactions.
  - Store only minimal payment-related data, if necessary, and encrypt it.
  - Implement role-based access control to restrict access to payment data.
  - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

#### **3. CCPA Compliance**
- **Requirements**:
  - Inform users about the categories of data collected and its purpose.
  - Allow users to opt out of data selling (if applicable).
  - Provide a mechanism for users to request data deletion.
  - Ensure data is not retained longer than necessary.

- **Implementation**:
  - Update the privacy policy to include details about data collection and usage.
  - Add an "opt-out" option for data sharing or selling.
  - Implement a data deletion request feature in the user interface.
  - Set up automated data retention policies to delete unused data.

## **Security Measures**

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest.
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher for data in transit.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users.
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.

3. **Audit Controls**:
   - Maintain logs of all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
   - Store logs in a secure, tamper-proof system for at least 12 months.

4. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for the system's functionality.
   - Regularly review and delete outdated or unnecessary data.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Develop an incident response plan to handle data breaches and security incidents.
   - Conduct regular drills to test the effectiveness of the response plan.

## **Validation of Compliance**

### **During Implementation**
1. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct regular code reviews to ensure compliance with encryption, authentication, and data handling standards.

2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Perform penetration testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

3. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Engage third-party auditors to verify compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA.

### **Post-Implementation**
1. **Monitoring**:
   - Use monitoring tools to track system performance and security.
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities.

2. **Regular Audits**:
   - Schedule annual compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to regulations.

3. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect feedback from users to identify and address privacy or security concerns.

## **Technical Notes**
1. **Normalization**: The database is normalized to the 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
2. **Scalability**: Indexes and relationships are designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
3. **Security**: Passwords are hashed, and JWT tokens are used for secure authentication.
4. **Compliance**: The system is designed to meet GDPR, PCI-DSS, and CCPA requirements.
