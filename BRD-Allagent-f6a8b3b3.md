# Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Retail Inventory Management System

## Overview
The Retail Inventory Management System is designed to streamline inventory tracking, automate restocking alerts, analyze sales trends, and manage user roles. The system must comply with relevant regulatory and compliance standards to ensure data security, privacy, and integrity.

## Compliance Standards

### 1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
#### Compliance Requirements:
- **Data Protection by Design and Default**: Implement technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection principles are integrated into the processing activities.
- **Data Subject Rights**: Ensure mechanisms are in place to handle data subject requests, such as access, rectification, and erasure.
- **Data Breach Notification**: Establish procedures to detect, report, and investigate personal data breaches.

#### System Implementation:
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process data necessary for the system's functionality.
- **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls to restrict data access to authorized users only.
- **Encryption**: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect personal data.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain logs of data access and processing activities to support audits and investigations.

### 2. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)
#### Compliance Requirements:
- **Secure Network**: Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data.
- **Data Protection**: Protect stored cardholder data and encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know.

#### System Implementation:
- **Network Security**: Implement firewalls and intrusion detection systems to secure the network.
- **Data Encryption**: Use strong encryption methods for storing and transmitting cardholder data.
- **Access Management**: Enforce strict access controls and regularly review access permissions.

### 3. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
#### Compliance Requirements:
- **Privacy Rule**: Protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
- **Security Rule**: Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI).
- **Breach Notification Rule**: Notify affected individuals and the Department of Health and Human Services in case of a breach.

#### System Implementation:
- **Data Anonymization**: Anonymize health-related data to prevent identification of individuals.
- **Security Measures**: Implement technical safeguards such as encryption, access controls, and audit controls to protect ePHI.
- **Incident Response**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan to address potential data breaches.

## Security Measures
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define user roles and permissions to ensure users have access only to the data necessary for their role.
- **Data Encryption**: Use industry-standard encryption protocols for data at rest and in transit.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate risks.

## Data Privacy Rules
- **Data Retention Policy**: Define data retention periods and ensure data is securely deleted when no longer needed.
- **Consent Management**: Obtain and manage user consent for data processing activities.
- **Privacy Notices**: Provide clear and transparent privacy notices to inform users about data collection and processing practices.

## Audit Controls
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track data access and processing activities.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed audit trails to support compliance audits and investigations.
- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of audit logs and access controls to ensure compliance with policies and regulations.

## Compliance Validation
- **Pre-Implementation**: Conduct a compliance assessment to ensure all regulatory requirements are addressed in the system design.
- **Post-Implementation**: Perform regular compliance audits and reviews to ensure ongoing adherence to regulatory standards.
- **Training and Awareness**: Provide training to employees on compliance requirements and best practices for data protection.

This BRD outlines the necessary compliance standards and measures to ensure the Retail Inventory Management System meets regulatory requirements and protects sensitive data.
