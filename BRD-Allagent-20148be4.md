- **Indexes:**
  - `product_id` in the Products table for faster lookups.
  - `location` in the Inventory table for efficient filtering by location.
  - `sale_date` in the Sales table for optimized date range queries.

- **Constraints:**
  - Foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity between tables.
  - Unique constraints on `product_id` in the Products table to prevent duplicate entries.

- **Triggers:**
  - Trigger to automatically update `updated_at` fields on record modification.

This schema ensures the system is robust, scalable, and capable of handling the required functionality efficiently.
