# Project Requirements

### Updated Business Requirements Document (BRD) with Compliance and Regulatory Standards

---

## Project Name: Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Overview
The Retail Inventory Management System is designed to provide a simple and efficient solution for tracking product stock levels, predicting restocking needs, and minimizing waste. The system will enable retail partners, PepsiCo's supply chain team, and warehouse managers to manage inventory in real-time, receive automated restocking alerts, and analyze sales trends.

---

### 2. Compliance and Regulatory Standards

#### Overview
To ensure the Retail Inventory Management System complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following analysis has been conducted. The system will adhere to applicable regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA (if applicable), and PCI-DSS, depending on the nature of the data being processed and stored.

---

#### Applicable Regulations and Compliance Requirements

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - **Applicability**: GDPR applies if the system processes personal data of individuals in the European Union (EU).  
   - **Compliance Requirements**:  
     - **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.  
     - **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.  
     - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.  
     - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.  
     - **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.  
   - **Implementation in the System**:  
     - Encrypt sensitive user data such as `password_hash` using industry-standard encryption algorithms.  
     - Implement a user interface for managing consent and data access requests.  
     - Log all data access and modification activities in the `Audit Logs` table.  
     - Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for data transmission.  

2. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
   - **Applicability**: HIPAA applies if the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI).  
   - **Compliance Requirements**:  
     - **Access Control**: Restrict access to PHI based on user roles.  
     - **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.  
     - **Data Integrity**: Ensure that PHI is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.  
     - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.  
   - **Implementation in the System**:  
     - If PHI is processed, ensure that access is restricted to authorized users based on their roles (`role` field in the `Users` table).  
     - Log all access and modifications to PHI in the `Audit Logs` table.  
     - Encrypt PHI using strong encryption algorithms.  

3. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
   - **Applicability**: PCI-DSS applies if the system processes payment card information.  
   - **Compliance Requirements**:  
     - **Secure Storage**: Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization.  
     - **Access Control**: Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel.  
     - **Encryption**: Encrypt cardholder data both in transit and at rest.  
     - **Vulnerability Management**: Regularly test the system for vulnerabilities.  
   - **Implementation in the System**:  
     - If payment card information is processed, ensure it is encrypted and not stored after authorization.  
     - Implement role-based access control to restrict access to payment data.  
     - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

### 3. Security Measures

#### Data Security
- **Encryption**:  
  - Encrypt sensitive data such as `password_hash` in the `Users` table.  
  - Use TLS/SSL for secure data transmission.  
- **Access Control**:  
  - Implement role-based access control using the `role` field in the `Users` table.  
  - Restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.  
- **Audit Logs**:  
  - Log all access and modifications to sensitive data in the `Audit Logs` table.  
  - Include details such as `user_id`, `action`, and `timestamp`.  

#### Data Privacy
- **Data Minimization**:  
  - Only collect and store data necessary for the system's functionality.  
- **Consent Management**:  
  - Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.  
- **Right to Access and Erasure**:  
  - Provide users with a mechanism to access their data and request its deletion.  

#### Incident Response
- **Data Breach Notification**:  
  - Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.  
- **Incident Logging**:  
  - Log all security incidents in the `Audit Logs` table for analysis and reporting.

### 4. Audit Controls

#### Overview
Audit controls are essential for ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and maintaining system integrity. The following audit controls will be implemented:

1. **Audit Logs Table**:  
   - Tracks changes and actions performed by users.  
   - Fields include `log_id`, `user_id`, `action`, and `timestamp`.  

2. **Triggers**:  
   - Automatically insert a record into the `Audit Logs` table for every update or delete operation in the `Inventory` table.  

3. **Access Monitoring**:  
   - Monitor and log all access to sensitive data.  

---

### 5. Compliance Validation

#### During Implementation
- Conduct regular code reviews to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.  
- Perform security testing, including vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.  
- Validate encryption mechanisms for data at rest and in transit.  

#### Post-Implementation
- Conduct periodic audits to ensure ongoing compliance.  
- Monitor system logs for unauthorized access or modifications.  
- Update the system to comply with any changes in regulatory requirements.
