### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The system will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
The key goals of the Retail Inventory Management System are:
- To provide a simple and efficient solution for managing retail inventory.
- To reduce stock shortages and overstocking.
- To improve supply chain efficiency.
- To enhance sales forecasting accuracy.

#### Problem Statement
Retail businesses often face challenges in managing inventory effectively, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. These issues can result in lost sales, increased costs, and inefficiencies in the supply chain. The Retail Inventory Management System aims to address these challenges by providing real-time inventory tracking, automated restocking alerts, and sales trend analysis.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Develop automated stock alert notifications.
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking within the first year.
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15% through better inventory management.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of the web-based application on AWS Cloud.
- Positive feedback from retail partners, PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers.
- Achievement of the defined goals and objectives within the project timeline and budget.
