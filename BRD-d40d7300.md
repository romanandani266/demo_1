# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the system's requirements and to facilitate communication and collaboration among all parties involved.

### Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes the development of a software system that supports the software development life cycle (SDLC) processes. The system will cover key functionalities such as project management, requirement gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The system will be limited to the functionalities outlined in this document and will not include any features or integrations not explicitly mentioned.

### Business Objectives
- To streamline the software development process by providing a centralized platform for managing SDLC activities.
- To improve collaboration and communication among project stakeholders.
- To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the development team.
- To ensure the timely delivery of high-quality software products.

### Problem Statement
The current software development process is fragmented and lacks a centralized system for managing SDLC activities. This leads to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform for managing the entire software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a user-friendly platform that supports all phases of the SDLC.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20% through improved process management.
- Increase team collaboration and communication by 30%.
- Achieve a 95% user satisfaction rate with the new system.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of all in-scope features and functionalities.
- Positive feedback from users and stakeholders.
- Achievement of the defined business objectives and goals.
- Completion of the project within the allocated budget and timeline.
