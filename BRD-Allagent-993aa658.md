### 10. Compliance and Regulatory Standards

#### Overview
The Retail Inventory Management System must comply with relevant regulatory and compliance standards to ensure data security, privacy, and operational integrity. This section outlines the applicable regulations, their requirements, and how the system will meet them. Additionally, it specifies the security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls that must be incorporated into the solution.

### Applicable Regulations

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
   - **Applicability**: The system will handle personal data of users (e.g., email addresses, usernames) and may be used in regions where GDPR is enforced.  
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the system's functionality.
     - **Consent Management**: Obtain explicit consent for collecting and processing personal data.
     - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Allow users to access their data and request its deletion.
     - **Data Breach Notification**: Notify relevant authorities and affected users within 72 hours of a data breach.
     - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt personal data both in transit and at rest.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256) for sensitive data like `password_hash` and `email`.
     - Implement a consent management module for user registration and data processing.
     - Provide a user interface for accessing and deleting personal data.
     - Set up automated alerts for potential data breaches and integrate with incident response workflows.

2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**  
   - **Applicability**: If the system integrates with payment processing for sales, PCI-DSS compliance is mandatory.  
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - **Secure Network**: Use firewalls and secure configurations to protect cardholder data.
     - **Data Protection**: Encrypt cardholder data and restrict access to authorized personnel.
     - **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data.
     - **Regular Monitoring**: Monitor and test networks regularly for vulnerabilities.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use tokenization for payment data to avoid storing sensitive cardholder information.
     - Integrate with PCI-compliant payment gateways for processing transactions.
     - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
     - Implement logging and monitoring for all payment-related activities.

3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**  
   - **Applicability**: If the system is used in healthcare retail (e.g., pharmacies), HIPAA compliance is required for handling Protected Health Information (PHI).  
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized users can access PHI.
     - **Audit Controls**: Maintain logs of all access and modifications to PHI.
     - **Data Integrity**: Protect PHI from unauthorized alteration or destruction.
     - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt PHI both in transit and at rest.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use RBAC to restrict access to PHI.
     - Implement audit logging for all actions involving PHI.
     - Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) for data transmission.
     - Encrypt PHI using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  
   - **Applicability**: If the system is used in California or handles data of California residents, CCPA compliance is required.  
   - **Key Requirements**:
     - **Data Transparency**: Inform users about the data being collected and its purpose.
     - **Opt-Out Options**: Allow users to opt out of data sharing or selling.
     - **Data Access and Deletion**: Provide users with access to their data and the ability to delete it.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Include a privacy policy detailing data collection and usage.
     - Provide an opt-out mechanism for data sharing.
     - Implement a user interface for data access and deletion requests.

### Security Measures

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., `password_hash`, `email`, payment data) using AES-256.
   - Use TLS 1.2 or higher for secure data transmission.

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement RBAC to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., "admin", "retail_partner", "warehouse_manager").
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Maintain logs of all user activities, including login attempts, data access, and modifications.
   - Store logs in a secure, tamper-proof system for at least 12 months.

4. **Vulnerability Management**:
   - Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
   - Apply security patches and updates promptly.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Develop an incident response plan for handling data breaches and security incidents.
   - Conduct regular drills to test the effectiveness of the plan.

### Data Privacy Rules

1. **Data Minimization**:
   - Collect only the data necessary for the system's functionality.
   - Avoid storing sensitive data unless absolutely required.

2. **Data Retention**:
   - Define retention periods for different types of data (e.g., sales data, user data).
   - Automatically delete or anonymize data after the retention period expires.

3. **User Consent**:
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection and processing.
   - Provide users with the ability to withdraw consent at any time.

4. **Data Anonymization**:
   - Anonymize data used for analytics to prevent identification of individuals.

---

### Audit Controls

1. **Access Logs**:
   - Maintain logs of all access to sensitive data, including the user ID, timestamp, and action performed.

2. **Change Logs**:
   - Record all changes to critical data (e.g., inventory levels, user roles).

3. **Compliance Audits**:
   - Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and CCPA.
   - Use third-party auditors for unbiased assessments.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Generate compliance reports for internal and external stakeholders.
   - Include details of data access, modifications, and security incidents.

### Validation of Compliance

1. **During Implementation**:
   - Conduct a compliance review at each development milestone.
   - Use automated tools to check for vulnerabilities and compliance gaps.
   - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure compliance features are functional.

2. **Post-Implementation**:
   - Schedule regular compliance audits (e.g., quarterly, annually).
   - Monitor system logs and alerts for potential compliance violations.
   - Update the system to address changes in regulatory requirements.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain detailed documentation of compliance measures, including policies, procedures, and audit results.
   - Provide training for staff on compliance requirements and best practices.
