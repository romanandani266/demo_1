### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for the design, development, and implementation of the system.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The system will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient inventory management system.
- Track product stock levels accurately.
- Predict restocking needs to minimize waste.
- Enhance supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and warehouse managers face challenges in managing inventory levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies in the supply chain and impacts sales forecasting. The current systems lack real-time tracking and automated alerts, which are crucial for effective inventory management.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.
- Achieve a reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by 20% within the first year.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all stakeholders.
- Real-time inventory tracking with a 95% accuracy rate.
- Automated restocking alerts reducing manual intervention by 50%.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers on usability and efficiency.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking system.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis tools.
- Web-based application using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be hosted on AWS Cloud.
- Budget limitations restrict advanced analytics features.
- Internet connectivity is required for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **User Story 1**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low, so I can reorder products timely.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and require minimal training.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional warehouses.
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime is required.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for integration with existing systems.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database and be accessible to warehouse managers.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) will be provided to illustrate data movement.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Minimalistic dashboard design.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Easy navigation paths for different user roles.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Consistent design language across the application.
