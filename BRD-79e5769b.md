---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking.
- Minimize waste through better inventory management.
- Improve supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and supply chain teams face challenges in managing inventory levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies and increased costs. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, hindering effective inventory management.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based application for inventory management.
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking.
- Enhance supply chain efficiency by 15%.
- Improve sales forecasting accuracy by 25%.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers.
- Measurable improvements in inventory management metrics.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The system will be developed using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.
- Budget limitations may restrict advanced analytics features.
- The system requires an internet connection for real-time tracking.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels are low to prevent shortages.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion to additional retail partners.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for data exchange.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database and back to the user interface.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Data will be managed through a centralized database with regular backups.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Include wireframes for the dashboard and key interfaces.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map the user journey from login to inventory management.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Design a minimalistic dashboard with easy navigation.
