# Project Requirements

# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The Business Requirements Document (BRD) is created to outline the requirements for the software development life cycle system. It serves as a comprehensive guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. The BRD is intended to facilitate communication, reduce misunderstandings, and provide a reference point throughout the project lifecycle.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting. The system will be limited to the preferred platform specified by the stakeholders and will not include any out-of-scope items mentioned in this document.

### Business Objectives
- Enhance project management efficiency.
- Improve collaboration among team members.
- Streamline the software development process.
- Provide real-time reporting and analytics.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards.

### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges in managing software development projects due to a lack of centralized tools and inefficient communication channels. This results in delays, increased costs, and reduced productivity. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive solution for managing the software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized project management system.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20%.
