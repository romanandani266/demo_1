## Project Name: Retail Inventory Management System

### Introduction
The Retail Inventory Management System project aims to develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory. This system will track product stock levels, predict restocking needs, and minimize waste, thereby enhancing the efficiency of inventory management for retail partners, the PepsiCo supply chain team, and warehouse managers.

### Business Objectives

   - Users should be able to configure alert thresholds and notification preferences.

3. **Sales Trend Analysis**
   - The system should analyze sales data to predict future inventory needs.
   - Reports should be generated to assist in decision-making for inventory purchases.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - The system should handle concurrent users efficiently without performance degradation.
   - Real-time updates should be reflected within seconds of a change in inventory levels.

2. **Scalability**
   - The system should be able to scale to accommodate an increasing number of users and inventory items.
   - The architecture should support future enhancements and integrations.

3. **Security**
   - Implement industry-standard security practices to protect sensitive data.
   - Ensure secure authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.

4. **Integration**
   - The system should integrate seamlessly with existing ERP and supply chain management systems.
   - APIs should be provided for third-party integrations.

5. **Usability**
   - The user interface should be intuitive and accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
   - Provide comprehensive user documentation and support.

#### Compliance Requirements

1. **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**
   - **Data Privacy**: Ensure that personal data of users is collected, processed, and stored in compliance with GDPR guidelines. Implement data anonymization and encryption.
   - **User Consent**: Obtain explicit consent from users for data collection and processing.
   - **Data Access and Portability**: Allow users to access their data and provide options for data portability.
   - **Data Breach Notification**: Implement procedures for notifying users and authorities in case of a data breach.

2. **PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**
   - **Data Security**: Protect cardholder data through encryption and secure storage.
   - **Access Control**: Implement strict access control measures to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.
   - **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

#### Security Measures
- Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
- Regularly update and patch software to protect against vulnerabilities.
- Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and protect the network.

#### Audit Controls
- Maintain logs of all user activities and system changes.
- Implement audit trails to track data access and modifications.
- Conduct regular compliance audits to ensure adherence to regulatory standards.

### Validation of Compliance
- **During Implementation**: Conduct regular reviews and testing to ensure compliance with GDPR and PCI-DSS requirements. Use automated tools for vulnerability scanning and compliance checks.
- **Post-Implementation**: Schedule periodic audits and assessments to validate ongoing compliance. Update policies and procedures as necessary to address any changes in regulations.

### Primary Deliverables
- A web-based inventory tracking system.
- Automated stock alert notifications.

### Out of Scope
- Any features or functionalities not related to inventory tracking, restocking alerts, or sales trend analysis.

### Preferred Platform
- Web-based application.

### Preferred Programming Language
- To be determined based on further technical assessment.

### Database Requirements
