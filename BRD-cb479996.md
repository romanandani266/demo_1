# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the system's requirements and to facilitate communication and collaboration among all parties involved.

### Scope of the Project
The system will cover the entire software development life cycle, from initial planning and requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance. It will include features such as project management, task tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting. The system will be limited to supporting the preferred platform, as specified, and will not include any out-of-scope items mentioned.

### Business Objectives
- To streamline the software development process and improve efficiency.
- To provide a centralized platform for project management and collaboration.
- To enhance communication and transparency among team members and stakeholders.
- To deliver a high-quality software product that meets the needs of the target audience.

### Problem Statement
The business currently faces challenges in managing software development projects due to a lack of centralized tools and processes. This results in inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive solution for managing the software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a user-friendly platform for project management and collaboration.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20% through improved process efficiency.
- Increase team productivity by providing tools for task tracking and reporting.
- Ensure high-quality software delivery by incorporating testing and quality assurance features.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful implementation and adoption of the system by the development team.
- Achievement of the defined goals and objectives within the project timeline.
- Positive feedback from users regarding the system's usability and effectiveness.
- Meeting the expected benefits and deliverables as outlined in the project objectives.
