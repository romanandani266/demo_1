### Business Objectives
- Improve inventory visibility and accuracy.
- Enhance decision-making with real-time data analytics.
- Enable seamless user authentication and access control.
- Reduce stock shortages and overstocking.
- Improve supply chain efficiency and sales forecasting.

### Problem Statement
The current inventory management processes face challenges such as inefficiencies in tracking inventory, difficulties in managing sales trends, and security vulnerabilities in user authentication.

### Goals & Objectives
- Reduce stockouts by 20%.
- Provide real-time analytics for inventory and sales.
- Improve inventory accuracy by 95%.
- Achieve a user adoption rate of 80% within the first 6 months.

### Key Success Criteria
- Response time for user interactions should be less than 2 seconds.
- Accuracy of inventory tracking should be above 95%.
- User adoption rates should reach 80% within 6 months.
