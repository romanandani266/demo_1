# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a software development life cycle system. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the system's requirements and to facilitate communication and collaboration among all parties involved.

### Scope of the Project
The scope of this project includes the development of a software system that supports the software development life cycle (SDLC) processes. The system will cover key functionalities such as project management, requirement gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The system will be limited to the functionalities outlined in this document and will not include any features or integrations not explicitly mentioned.

### Business Objectives
- To streamline the software development process by providing a centralized platform for managing SDLC activities.
- To improve collaboration and communication among project stakeholders.
- To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the development team.
- To ensure the timely delivery of high-quality software products.

### Problem Statement
The current software development process is fragmented and lacks a centralized system for managing SDLC activities. This results in inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in project delivery. The proposed system aims to address these issues by providing a comprehensive platform for managing the entire software development life cycle.

### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a centralized platform for managing SDLC activities.
- Improve project visibility and tracking for stakeholders.
- Enhance team collaboration and communication.
- Reduce project delivery time by 20%.
- Increase software quality by reducing defects by 30%.

### Key Success Criteria
- Successful implementation of the system within the defined timeline and budget.
- Positive feedback from stakeholders and end-users.
- Achievement of the defined goals and objectives.
- High user adoption rate and satisfaction.
