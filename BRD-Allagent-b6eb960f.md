# Project Requirements

To ensure the solution complies with all relevant regulatory and compliance standards, the following section will be added to the Business Requirements Document (BRD). This section will analyze the applicable compliance standards, outline their requirements, and specify how the system will meet them. Additionally, security measures, data privacy rules, and audit controls will be documented, along with instructions for validating compliance during and after implementation.

## **8. Regulatory and Compliance Standards**

### **8.1 Applicable Compliance Standards**
Based on the business requirements and the nature of the system, the following compliance standards are applicable:

1. **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: Applicable due to the collection and processing of user data, including email addresses and roles.
2. **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)**: Applicable if the system handles payment card information (not explicitly mentioned in the BRD but should be considered if future payment processing is added).
3. **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: Not applicable unless the system processes Protected Health Information (PHI).
4. **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**: Applicable if the system serves California residents and collects personal data.
5. **ISO/IEC 27001**: Recommended for general information security management.

### **8.2 Compliance Requirements and Implementation**

#### **8.2.1 GDPR**
- **Requirements:**
  - Obtain user consent for data collection and processing.
  - Provide users with the ability to access, modify, or delete their data.
  - Ensure data is stored securely and encrypted.
  - Notify users of data breaches within 72 hours.
  - Maintain records of data processing activities.

- **Implementation:**
  - Add a consent mechanism during user registration.
  - Implement a user dashboard for data access, modification, and deletion.
  - Encrypt sensitive data such as `password_hash` and `email` using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
  - Set up a breach notification system to alert users and authorities.
  - Maintain an audit log of all data processing activities in the `Import_Export_Logs` table.

#### **8.2.2 PCI-DSS**
- **Requirements:**
  - Encrypt payment card data during transmission and storage.
  - Restrict access to cardholder data to authorized personnel.
  - Implement strong access control measures.
  - Regularly test security systems and processes.

- **Implementation:**
  - If payment processing is added, ensure card data is encrypted and stored in a PCI-compliant environment.
  - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
  - Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

#### **8.2.3 CCPA**
- **Requirements:**
  - Inform users about the categories of personal data collected and the purpose of collection.
  - Allow users to opt out of data selling (if applicable).
  - Provide a mechanism for users to request data deletion.

- **Implementation:**
  - Update the privacy policy to include details about data collection and usage.
  - Add an "opt-out" feature for data sharing.
  - Extend the user dashboard to include a "Request Data Deletion" option.

#### **8.2.4 ISO/IEC 27001**
- **Requirements:**
  - Establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
  - Conduct regular risk assessments.
  - Implement controls to mitigate identified risks.

- **Implementation:**
  - Develop an ISMS policy and document it.
  - Perform periodic risk assessments and update the ISMS accordingly.
  - Implement technical controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure coding practices.

### **8.3 Security Measures**
1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive fields such as `password_hash` and `email` using AES-256.
2. **Access Control**: Implement RBAC using the `role` field in the `Users` table.
3. **Audit Logs**: Use the `Import_Export_Logs` table to track all data import/export activities.
4. **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS for all data transmission.
5. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

---

### **8.4 Data Privacy Rules**
1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the system's functionality.
2. **Data Retention**: Define a data retention policy and implement automatic deletion of old records.
3. **User Rights**: Provide users with tools to access, modify, or delete their data.

---

### **8.5 Audit Controls**
1. **Change Tracking**: Use triggers to log changes in critical tables such as `Users`, `Products`, and `Inventory`.
2. **Access Logs**: Maintain logs of all user access and actions.
3. **Compliance Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other applicable standards.

---

### **8.6 Compliance Validation**
1. **During Implementation**:
   - Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to identify and mitigate risks.
   - Perform unit and integration testing to ensure compliance features are working as intended.
   - Engage a third-party auditor to review the system for compliance.

2. **After Implementation**:
   - Schedule regular compliance audits.
   - Monitor for changes in regulatory requirements and update the system accordingly.
   - Use automated tools to continuously monitor for vulnerabilities and compliance gaps.
