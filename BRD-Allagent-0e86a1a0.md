## Technical Requirements

### 1. **System Capabilities**
- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: 
  - Use WebSocket or RESTful APIs to fetch and update inventory data in real-time.
  - Implement a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Automated Restocking Alerts**:
  - Use a rule-based engine to trigger alerts when stock levels fall below predefined thresholds.
  - Integrate with email and SMS notification services (e.g., Twilio, AWS SNS).
- **Sales Trend Analysis**:
  - Use a data analytics library (e.g., Pandas, NumPy) to process and analyze sales data.
  - Generate visual reports using libraries like Plotly or Chart.js.

---

### 2. **Technologies and Tools**
- **Frontend**:
  - React.js for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
  - Material-UI or Bootstrap for pre-designed UI components.
- **Backend**:
  - Flask for building RESTful APIs.
  - Celery for handling asynchronous tasks (e.g., sending notifications).
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
  - Use database indexing and query optimization for performance.
- **Hosting and Deployment**:
  - AWS EC2 for hosting the application.
  - AWS RDS for database management.
  - AWS S3 for storing static assets (e.g., images, reports).
- **Security**:
  - Use AWS IAM for managing access control.
  - Implement HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates.
  - Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256 encryption.

---

### 3. **Integration Requirements**
