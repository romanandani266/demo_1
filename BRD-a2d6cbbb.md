### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The project will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient system for managing retail inventory.
- Enhance the accuracy of stock level tracking.
- Minimize waste through better inventory management.
- Improve supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and warehouse managers face challenges in maintaining optimal stock levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies in the supply chain and impacts sales forecasting accuracy. The current systems lack real-time tracking and automated alerts, making it difficult to respond promptly to inventory needs.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated notifications for restocking.
- Enable sales trend analysis for better forecasting.
- Achieve a reduction in stock shortages and overstocking by 20% within the first year.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application accessible to all stakeholders.
- Real-time inventory tracking with a 95% accuracy rate.
- Automated restocking alerts reducing manual intervention by 50%.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers on system usability.
