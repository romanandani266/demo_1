### 5. **Requirements**

#### **Functional Requirements:**
1. **Real-Time Inventory Tracking:**
   - Monitor stock levels across multiple locations.
   - Provide a dashboard for quick insights into inventory status.

2. **Automated Restocking Alerts:**
   - Notify users when stock levels fall below predefined thresholds.
   - Allow customization of alert settings based on product type and location.

3. **Sales Trend Analysis:**
   - Analyze historical sales data to predict future inventory needs.
   - Generate reports to assist in decision-making.

4. **User Management:**
