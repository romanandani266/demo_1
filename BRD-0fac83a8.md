## Retail Inventory Management System

---

### 1. Introduction

#### Purpose of the BRD
The purpose of this Business Requirements Document (BRD) is to outline the requirements for the development of a Retail Inventory Management System. This document serves as a guide for stakeholders, project managers, and the development team to ensure a clear understanding of the project objectives, scope, and deliverables. It is intended to facilitate communication and provide a foundation for project planning and execution.

#### Scope of the Project
The Retail Inventory Management System will cover the following aspects:
- Real-time tracking of product stock levels.
- Automated alerts for restocking needs.
- Analysis of sales trends to predict future inventory requirements.

Limitations:
- The system will not include advanced AI-driven forecasting capabilities.
- Mobile application development is out of scope.

#### Business Objectives
- Develop a simple and efficient inventory management system.
- Track product stock levels accurately.
- Predict restocking needs to minimize waste.
- Enhance supply chain efficiency.

#### Problem Statement
Retail partners and supply chain teams face challenges in managing inventory levels, leading to stock shortages or overstocking. This results in inefficiencies and increased costs. The current systems lack real-time tracking and predictive capabilities, hindering effective inventory management.

#### Goals & Objectives
- Implement a web-based inventory tracking system.
- Provide automated stock alert notifications.
- Achieve a 20% reduction in stock shortages and overstocking.
- Improve supply chain efficiency by 15%.

#### Key Success Criteria
- Successful deployment of a web-based application.
- Real-time inventory tracking with 95% accuracy.
- Automated alerts functioning as intended.
- Positive feedback from retail partners and warehouse managers.

### 2. Project Scope & Requirements

#### In-Scope Items
- Real-time inventory tracking.
- Automated restocking alerts.
- Sales trend analysis.
- Web-based application development using Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and React.

#### Out-of-Scope Items
- Advanced AI-driven forecasting.
- Mobile application development.

#### Assumptions & Constraints
- The project will operate within budget limitations, affecting advanced analytics capabilities.
- Internet connectivity is required for real-time tracking.
- The system will use PostgreSQL for database management.

#### Functional Requirements (Use Cases & User Stories)
- **Use Case 1**: As a warehouse manager, I want to view real-time stock levels to make informed restocking decisions.
- **Use Case 2**: As a retail partner, I want to receive automated alerts when stock levels fall below a threshold.
- **User Story 1**: As a member of the supply chain team, I want to analyze sales trends to predict future inventory needs.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security**: Implement role-based access control and encrypted data storage.
- **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Scalability**: The system should support future expansion.
- **Availability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards for data protection.

#### Technical Requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, React.
- **Architecture**: Microservices architecture.
- **API Requirements**: RESTful APIs for data exchange.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integration with existing supply chain tools.

#### Data Management
- **Data Flow**: Data will flow from retail partners to the central database, with real-time updates.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL will be used for data storage.
- **Management**: Data will be managed through a centralized dashboard.

#### UI/UX Requirements
- **Wireframes**: Include wireframes for the dashboard and key interfaces.
- **User Journey Mapping**: Map the user journey from login to inventory management.
- **User Interface Specifications**: Minimalistic design with easy navigation.
